       "'my new oled is a upgrade and its great  this is my third vizio tv to replace my first one that went blank after 12 years of stellar service im even thinking of getting it repaired if possible for the great grand kids   i have always liked the picture quality and the price of vizios you cant go wrong rating is really a 45 but thats unavailable the unit looks great both in and off it is short on physical features bluetooth and whatnot but i use both external sound and media units this is a great oled to buy if you want a great tv at a reasonable price i’m quite pleased with the entire product as a whole the quality of picture and sound really speaks for itself when in use i’ve only had my new visio oled65 mounted and operating for 3 days now and i’m like a kid who after christmas can’t get enough of his favorite gift the brightness and clarity of the picture is another huge by step forward in the evolution of  the television i find myself seeking out programming that will showcase the quality of the picture regardless of the genre or intended audience some of the newer computer generated cartoons lack any redeemable qualities imho save for the incredible graphics which are stunningly colorful bright and almost as vivid as real life nature documentaries and shows involving space especially when shot in 4k are almost mesmerizing when i bought my 65” hd tv about 10 years ago i thought i was witnessing the best quality picture that could be produced by anything this side of a mirror i was wrong and happily so if you’re on the fence like i was about whether to replace a broken or outdated television with another of similar hd quality that is to say “standard high definition”don’t even waste your time it’s increasingly difficult to find as 4k is becoming ubiquitous so that is pretty much a given on the subject of spending your hard earned money on the more expensive oled technologyif you have the means or can somehow figure out how to acquire the meansmy advice is definitely do so whether you’re into movies sports gaming or even naturespace shows you will be amazed at the latest leap in picture quality and brightness and vizio offers all the quality at a substantial savings putting the absolute best technology within the reach of those of us for whom the strength of the stock market makes absolutely no difference to our bottom line \\r\\nfyithe 65” hd television i had to replace was a samsung that was about 4 or 5 years old that stopped working after some loud cracking and popping noises that sounded like the transformer on an overhead power line blowing out however my 42” vizio that i bought in ‘08 doesn’t even have a single bad pixel food for thought the picture is very crisp and the blacks very dark  beautiful color  the vizio smartcast app is fantastic  the response from selections is much faster than the traditional supplied remote  they update it from time to time with most recent voice search function picture quality is amazing however within a week from purchasing the tv will not turn on unless i unplug and plug it back in image is so clear i feel like i’m on the set of the shows i purchased this tv about 2 weeks ago and am blown away by the crisp 4k picture  i would definitely recommend this tv to someone considering an upgrade i got this today 225 for my birthday present from my son as a surprise gift without any prior guess or information at all my previous one in my master bed room was quite old samsung 50” pd tv which was ok but heavy and bulky compared to this \\r\\ni am so happy to have this wonderful big one for my first oled tv of which screen is fantastic and very light compared to my previous one indeed best price on an oled tv has a great picture and is easy to navigate the menus and connect via apple or android devices i always bought lg oled tvs because i liked their quality and features but so far vizio is just as good and a better price just like the elite controller v2 but halo edition one of the best controllers out there if you do not have one elite’s controller’s are must have first foray with the elite controller nothing but impressed the weight in the hand the grip the buttons and changeable joysticks are all amazing even better is the masterchief finish if you cant find the halo edition id recommend trying the regular elite series 2 ill never use a different xbox controller again really bought this for the blue mode leds just to find out they are still white leds with a blue coating on them and not that bright all in all still an elite controller at first i was asking myself why spend the crazy money on a controller  i too am now a believer  from the case to cable to finally making its way to the actual controller  it is special in every way  there is so much detail to this controller  lets not forget it is a limited edition and carries a beautiful halo design the build of this controller is perfect and the details are amazing cortana herself lives within this controller i am one with halo this controller has always been great but this one is a work of art even lighter than my previously owned elite series 2 thought it would be heavier the buttons the triggers the analogue sticks everything operates better than the original elite series 2 at launch \\r\\n\\r\\nthis thing is only 20 more than the es2 and you know they could’ve easier made it 100 more and still sold out amazing these controllers i think are worth the money one of my favorite things is that i no longer need double a batteries it comes with a charging port and how i can customize the buttons is rad love the controller use it everytime i play the remote plays excellent be carefull of the back buttons though do to being removable i feel like they will wear out faster than most yoshi game was awesome and still playing it thank u sooo much gamestop  great game you will enjoy it good price worth it i always have enjoyed the super mario series since mario brothers in the arcade my son loves to play this game hes been playing it every day since he got it great job the game is great for a family and younger children my 4 year old wnjoys the game it would be better if poochy was in all of the levels its cute and fun but feels a little lacking in fulfilling its potential good game including game play and music also music the quirky style that shined in yoshi’s wooly world has gotten a serious upgrade in this new gem from nintendo  like all it’s firstparty titles this game is nearly flawless\\nthe “crafted world” is exceptionally detailed with cardboard cutouts pinterest worth constructions and vibrant colors that pop on everything from the tiny switch screen to a 70” flatscreen tv\\nthe gameplay is tight with seamless reaction times and plenty of opportunities to save yourself from mistakes  easy enough for kids to pick up but easily enjoyed by gamers of all ages\\nmost importantly this game is fun she loves it good game it easy to play and addicting yoshi‘s crafted world is the best nintendo game i ever played since yoshi‘s woolly world lots of hard challenges to complete and it’s so much fun i love this game i recently bought this tv and was blown as easy with the picture quality i never want not to go back to led i went from an old lcd tv to this ola tv and the picture quality is amazing this tv has a deep as blocks of ever seen the sound quality is fantastic i could not be happier bought this yesterday and i am really excited i saw how clear the picture was and had to have it won out over my husband who wanted the sony\\r\\nhe agreed this morning while watching nascar that i was right yeah for me ive had this tv for 3 weeks now so far i really like the picture its hooked up to a vizio 21 sound bar it is confusing when i 1st turn the tv on  i get the vizio sign on the screen a few moments later the picture comes on with the tv speakers then the tv shuts off a few seconds pass and he comes back on with the sidebar act of and everything is ok then dont understand why it goes off comes on goes off and comes back on great tv at at a reasonable price  happy so far with purchase i love that i found an oled that did not break the bank the picture quality is amazing and vcast is great the only downside is the sound and it’s only a small complaint on the quality easy setup and there you goi love vizio tv i will continue to buy vizio tvs  very good image quality beautiful design on a affordable price oled is king i’ll never go back to traditional led tvs again it’s just not even in the same ballpark you can’t beat the picture quality of and oled im a true fan of vizio my old 36 vizio lasted me a very long time and thats the reason why i decided to stick with vizio visuals are amazing on this oled there are some bugs but they can be repaired by software update patches released by vizio i also bought the vizio atmos soundbar and its absolutely freegin awesome only issue ive experienced is the sound bar doesnt activate on its own and i usually have to cycle through the settings to reactivate through hdmiarc imsure theres a fix for it overall im happy with it and still feel vizio makes great products it’s amazing works perfect just as an elite controller should the best part is the paint job 1010 recommend this controller provides excellent fine motor control with adjustable thumbstick tension and removable back peddles  it works great especially for a first person shooting game like halo infinite  it’s on the pricey side but you know this is a premium product for serious gamers best xbox controller ive owned worth every penny owned for a month with no issues only con is i wish there were replacement joysticks i love these but i know im going to wear them out and i wont have master cheif green ones to replace  great controller purchase was definitely worth it the only problem was the finalizing my payment and the late shipment through gamestop this controller is incredibly responsive it’s fully customizable with lots of additional features  settings that can be adjusted to your preferences i was skeptical at first due to the price but after a fair amount of use i wouldn’t game with anything else love the controller no probs with it the first one was lost but customer service made sure i got another one and in a timely manner so beautiful great addition to my halo collection the detail is just amazing performs like any other elite series 2 but that color scheme is just phenomenal great controller beautiful design ultimate customization doesn’t even feel like an elite controller but it does feel like an advance one with the grips and joystick converters not really worth the money but the design is amazing and there is no battery pack in the back it’s all built in like a phone over all i love it i’m such a halo fan it was a no brainer not to get it feels great it enhances gameplay thanks to the paddles and customizability and it looks absolutely beautiful tons of fun to play with my kids they love the look and ease of play awsome title loads of fun my kids and i love it this game is amazing almost had given up on the switch but this game saved that from happening its a great game for people of all ages fun and cute but some of the mechanics dont work that well tank yoshi and the mutillayer egg aiming still fun but needs improvement in the mentioned areas see caddicarus analysis its awesome the graphics make everything look like cardboard fun title that is a good installment to the series a little bit easy to beat but has plenty of extras to keep entertained while going for that 100 this game was fir my youngest he picked it out from good reviews online it can be 1 or 2 players it’s pretty simple mechanics but there are so many creative was to use them and there is a lot of replay ability me and wife have a blast it’s a game that’s for kids and for adults to enjoy purchased this tv a couple of weeks ago as my existing tv was 10 years old and needed an upgrade  had a salesman take the time to show me the differences between an oled and other projection systems  couldnt be happier with the picture that i am not experiencing my wife loves it she even lets me play the coop mode with her sometimes i’m not that into gaming but this game is really fun this oled is excellent very easy to operate i imagine that someone may complain but i am certain that it will be a tribal thing great tv i like the vizio appsthe sound is nothing special but if you are buying an oled you probably have another option the best part is the deep true black the colors are very vibrant i am very satisfied has some bugs and i know vizio will work on them a little faster especially with the new xbox series x and ps5 other than that can’t beat the price for an oled tv great picture now vizio please get the vrr  4k120 to work and give us the option to change all picture setting in game mode no settings should be blanked out i bought this for my birthday and it has been amazing\\r\\nwonderful oled tv i love the tv and everything about it i am a big fan of vizio tvs except for the sound you will need a soundbar all my vizio tvs have held up under use hoping the new oleds will get firmware updates and continue to make this tv great now and in the future very good oled tv for the price but it does have some issues with powering on  if you leave it idle for too long it will “go to sleep” and the only way to cut it back on is to power cycle  other than that i love it beautiful screen awesome price but full of bugs on my set had to constantly unplug my tv from the  power supply to get it to come on worked well with my xbox series x just a few glitches here and there no 4k 120 for the ps5 so i had to use the 4k 60 hdmi slot i feel this tv is still in beta and needs alot of firmware updates to address system performance issues i bought this tv because i wanted to try out oled for the first time i’m glad i bought it the colors and contrast are on point the price compared to the competition in the same category can’t be beat super happy everything i wanted from a controller in an amazing custom paint job the design is very remarkable great addition to the collection of halo series x console bundle it a must have i love the pro controller and this one is absolutely beautiful must buy works good its perfect for people who game hardcore because it dont ware out as fast and last a long time cheaply priced perfect for your gaming set up i love the classic colors of master chief looks great with my halo theme xbox axyb buttons do no register unless they are 100 fully pressed in annoying there is no pressure sensitivity this no longer available item is excellent and you should buy one but you can’t great controller love the way it feels and all the little halo touches it has so far i love the feel and look of this controller need to wait and see how the grips hold up to give it a 5 star rating i was lucky to cop a limited edition elite controller  waiting for halo campaign to used this game has amazing graphics and amazing levels it fun for your family and if you have kids they will enjoy hours of fun i loved the yoshi yarn game on the 3ds  i love the new yoshi yarn game on the switch\\r\\nmore color yoshi’s to choose from and a forward and backwards game in every course it’s a lovable game to play great game love every minute of it fun and entertaining excellent condition awesome game my fiance is enjoying it a lot one of the best games ive played in a while absolutely beautiful ❤️ 1010 it is a very creative thinking out of the box game it might be a bit easy but it is fun to and i will 100 it even if its the last thing i do omg this is the ultimate of fun silly fantasy escapism sit back relax and give yourself an hour to let yoshi explore the handmade world of tape cardboard and pipe cleaners takes me back to the 90s thank you nintendo and thank you gamestop for always having great prices and what i want in stock really cute game and its pretty easy for the non gamer  its great to have a son who can help you too i purchased several television and soundbars from vizio from the m series and the sb38 i purchased this oled over a week ago along with the vizio elevate soundbar for my new xbox series x i truly appreciate the picture quality experience that this tv can offer the performance of this tv and soundbar surely surpass its price point i strongly recommend this tv for anyone that wants the best performance for the money i will dare to say that based on my research this tv will absolutely rival other brands at much more expensive price points i had purchased this knowing it was going to not be perfect but omg i had to go in and change my ps4 setting for video to even use the menu settings at all i also cannot use netflix it wont open from smartcast but when i press the button on the remote it freezes the whole tv on a black screen this is a serious deal breaking bug i purchased this a week ago and so far so good its to early to make a define decision i wanted to buy this for long but i am a bit disappointed i guess my expectations were high but not really sky high\\r\\npros\\r\\n1 the picture is absolutely gorgeous and you can tune it further to your choice\\r\\n2 the smartcast interface is decent\\r\\n3 the remote is also not bad at all\\r\\n4 very quick to connect apple play \\r\\n5 there are ample connection options for my bedroom\\r\\ncons\\r\\n1 cast is buggy i can never get it to run first time this is where i would focus most of the development time if i were vizio\\r\\n2 smart cast does not have a browser app that is accessible easily\\r\\n3 there is no easy way to add more apps that are not already in the vizio library\\r\\n4 the detail picture quality will not go up to the level you get out of a top line oled \\r\\n5 the bezel is still not near zero bezel size it is sizable to be noticeable\\r\\n\\r\\noverall for the price it is a good deal the best the tv offers great contrast and clarity \\r\\nthe good smart casting features \\r\\nthe bad precalibrations could improve\\r\\nthe ugly very very buggy software doesnt start a lot of times and have to replug many times brings me anxiety this screen is a beauty very sharp good colors and decent brightness i hook it up to my pc for gaming and occasionally have some quirks in the middle of a game it says no signal detected and shuts off sometimes it isnt detected by the pc \\r\\na few quirks with the ps5 too sometimes when i power on the tv it also turns on the ps5 sometimes when i power on the ps5 the tv turns on too neither seems to be consistent \\r\\nneeds and hbo max app also needs to be able to disable inputs from the list like in previous vizio models \\r\\nall minor issues and possibly handled via software or firmware updates the hardware is solid though i bought this 2 weeks ago and has a great picture it is good for gaming on the xbox series one the only issue is the vrr does not work and has a distorted picture when i enable it i love the pristine picture with saturated accurate colors however i absolutely hate not being able to turn off the fluctuating luminance the only thing that spoils a great review is the brightness that changes with how dark the screen is to increase contrast the tv does not need it and if i knew who the engineer was that omitted the off selection for this annoyance i would offer him a vizio necklace the only issue i have is i own both ps5 and xbox series x and if i use hdmi ports 2 and 3 4k 120hz i have to unplug the tv every time i turn the tv on i worked around this by using ports 1 and 4 so im stuck at 4k 60hz on both consoles unless i want to constantly unplug the tv for it to work but over all i love the oled tv and you have to get a polarized power cable because vizio gives you a non polarized power cable that does not fit the tv power port great item and excellent condition works awesome very cool design feels great and comfortable in my hands this halo infinite elite series 2 controller is so awesome with the halo theme on it its beautiful  being able to customize the controller to my liking ranging from the controller sticks dpad and how short you want your trigger throw is freaking amazing compared to a normal controller  only con is that its expensive but once you open up the whole package and unboxing experience it is well worth the price packaging was 5 stars alone but the feel and customizability of the control and the design made it over the top and it came with the full game download love this controller glad gamestop pro was lookin out and it came in a decent time the microsoft elite 2 pro controller is perfect for the console gamer of any level the fact that it’s the halo edition makes it that much better i love the controller and i’m glad they came out with this limited edition this is a piece of art amazing very well design and heavy feeling it truly makes you feel like you have a betterquality controller compared to the regular xbox series x controller would recommend to any gamer specially halo fan this was my first elite controller and i love it it’s definitely a game changer and looks beautiful the controller is great but i am experiencing stick drift just two days after receiving it awesome love this character love the whole game excellent for a relaxing time can be challenging if you want to 100 every level fun and exciting game if you like yoshi and his classic games the game is adorable the music isnt earsplitting and the levels themselves are fun however it ends up becoming a chore if you intend to 100 the game with multiple scavenger hunts per stage with a flipside that is dedicated to finding three dogs under a certain amount of time for the full reward ultimately its cute and full of heart but is not recommended to just sit down and 100 in one sitting its quick easy fun enjoyable in small bursts either alone or with a friend i’m not a big gamer i was so excited when this came out i had to get it i guess i just expected more nostalgically entertaining and unique 3d adventure that will make it hard for you to put the controller down bought this game for my 12 yr olds birthday  he really likes to play in multiplayer mode with me  definitely fun bonding time  so far it has been fairly easy to finish each section without being too easy working together helps  i do hope it gets a little harder as we get a little further in good to see yoshi on the switch but it is a slight step down from yoshi‘s woolly world truly amazing the art style is unique and the gameplay is equally fun as it is relaxing and rewarding i got this game so me and my gf can play together its fun and quirky but gets challenging some folks didnt like this gamethought it didnt measure up to the original or forged alliance boy are they wrong i thought this game was great maybe the tech tree is a tiny bit smaller but the game more than makes up for it with new cool units great graphics and effects and awesome explosions in fairness i was a little perturbed that that more than one engineer cannot build on the same structure as in the previous games but then again the structures go up pretty quick happy hunting great game nothing bad about it it has many great features and story mode is cool i think it is awesome there is no infantry which annoys me a lot because i like the classic infantry cavalryarmor artillary idea the steam engine is annoying its really laggy and slow there are like 5 real units per race and then everything else is an experimental which i really dont like since they are impossible to kill and one experimental unit can kil 10 regular without even trying the ai is ok but they are just annoying the game is really confusing and not very fun i have to get updates everytime i want to play even when i dont play it online at all i hate patches the upgrade trees are wierd and require research to get which takes forever overall this game isnt good starcraft 2 is much better if your looking for an rts and shogun total war is also really good just dont get this this game in my opinion is waay better than cc and is very good in gameplay and everything else some people say that he storyline is horrible but that doesnt really effect me since i just play on the skirmish and online the story line isnt really a big concern i just play it when im bored the story is extremely slow and confusing until you get later into it it forces you to play as a certain faction first then another and end with the cybrans you should definitely try out the originals they are ten times better then this overall the gameplay is about the same as the last game the graphics are much better and the sound and music is again amazing however the story development needs more work alright here comes the best game eva anyway herz a shout out to all of the peeps that think this game is the best eva u rock 4 ur good reviews anyway the graphics might not be as good as the first but the graphics to me doesnt matter at all since the campaign is awsome and a good storyline along with the campaign the units and multiplayer maps and experimentals and ect but i honestly i think the unit count is very low there should be a higher unit count because people have things to do units to make and probably alot of them too and places 4 them to go like in others bases and stuff this game is the absolute best rts game you can play and i have played alot of rts games so i know what im talking about this game has very good graphics and they will be even more enjoyable the more you paly the game considering that you notice things like shadows cast by the terrain and details such as distortion coming out of a walkers exhaust pipes this game also has an amazing command system there are more controls and options you can use to make your army do anything imaginable this game also includes extra experimental weapons which they balanced much better than on the first one and actually have a general purpose rather than to walk into the enemies base and kill and most people have heard that the nukes on the second ones are pitiful compared to the first the difference is that on the first one it was a bright light and smoke covering a large area of the map on this one it might be only a little bit smaller but it is insanely detailed in the fact that an extremely large portion of the map gets lit up in red and things are actually moving with the explosion as they would in real life when it touches water it makes steam and jets it into the air so nukes on this one are much more enjoyable to watch regardless of what youve heard all in all 10 stars i dont know why people dont like this game because if you like realtime strategy or rts this is the game to get                                                                                                                                                                                                      i usually only play online and play skirmishes to get better or if no one is as good as me because i can destroy anyone                                                                                                                                                                                                  i am a veteran at call of duty modern warfare 1 and 2 so dont try and kill me or fight me what gas powered games have done here is amazing this game is packed with more units new features less glitches and a lot more excitment what i was really taken with is that there is no mass or mass anymore its all based on real numbers the tech tree feature is amazing allowing you to upgrade old units to make them more lethal later in the game a lot of the good things are still their like the cybran ships being able to crawl onto land however the story is disappointing character extremely lack any sort of personality and emotions also for high end computers this game has surprising lower graphics units like the uef titan look a little bit more like legos even though some units have good deatil others are flat out bad although you have to appreciate that they are trying to let computers with lower hardware able to run this game online play and skirmish mode are fun supreme commander 2 is different than its predecessors i say it should just have a completely different name slapped onto it then i would of not had any quarrels with it because i wouldnt be expecting something so different than what i knew now i own both of the previous games and they are both excellent and so when i found out about this sequel i ran out and bought it with out much looking into it i knew it had a different maker but i figured how bad could they have possibly made it i mean its square enix now dont get me wrong it is a good game but i was expecting to buy sc2 not sc2 revamped i couldnt just jump into it i had to learn the new feel to the game in sc2 you now get to your good units by having to research most of them and experimental units are really not that great yea they are all based of the old games models but i think that most kinda suck comparatively like the experimental units for so called game breakers as they were know for in the old games u can make them with very little ease and there not nearly as effective as they use to be which i guess is the trade off for it but even hordes of units can crumble in no time it seems  regular units are just knock offs of the original ones and are only really good when you upgrade them via research  however i do think the research is a cleaver aspect of the game and the brand new unitsstructures that were added are a nice touch but it does usually take awhile to get to them in the research tree even with the research facilities which u can build to increase research income  completely  also the variety of units is gone there use to be at least 2 sets of everything a lower cost lower tech versions and the higher end units which i prefer the variety of them because they all had there uses lower tech units could be used as cannon fodder as your high end tech marches on or even if you had to come up with an army quickly  all that said i do still play it as ive gotten use to it but i am still disappointed if you are looking for something different to play with a somwhat familiar story then you would like the game play especially online to which it seems that it was made for but if your expecting the feel of the original game then i would say go play one of the old ones 2 player fun for dad and 10 year old replay value is high with extra modes after completion my son been waiting on this game for a long time but he got it now and he love it im in love with everything from this game and i appreciate the replay value as well you can go back to a level and find new tasksgoals brings back so many memories i absolutely love this game it actually looks crafty and there is so much to explore and you can\\r\\nmake\\r\\nstuff in your house the cutesy graphics and creative levels definitely added to the childlike wonder and fun of the game even the creepier levels were cute but still gave you goosebumps at the same time i like the simple creativity nothing too over the top just very creative it’s sort of too easy so it’s something to pass time with overall a good purchase fun imaginative and challenging at times great deal of replay ability fantastic game the level designs are inventive and memorable  i havent had this much fun with a game since the days of the nesgenesis this game is so much fun  you can easily run though a level or you can take your time and find all the hidden things  i love to play it and so does my daughter i’ve been very hesitant to upgrade to an oled because i couldn’t justify the cost but when vizio jumped into the oled market i was very excited other brands’ “budget oleds” cut corners whereas vizio’s track record with reasonably priced premium tvs is outstanding\\r\\n\\r\\nthe important thing you might not first look for in a tv is how black the blacks are followed by how light the screen can be without a terrible contrast this tv fit the bill for both also this tv is fully ready for the max features of the series x and ps5\\r\\n\\r\\nthe only issue i have is the speakers leave a bit to be desired they’re ok but if you want a theater experience buy a sound bar or speakers this is my 3rd vizio tv 1st oled they are all 5 star products easy to set up to program and assemble smart tv is very convenient i bought this tv right before thanksgiving and have enjoyed it ever since i wanted a smart tv and this did not disappoint i bought a smaller one for my bedroom as the title states the picture is good as expected the only downside so far is that there are serious handshaking issues between this tv and my ps5 console sometimes ive got a black screen and must reboot the tv to get the ps5 display to come up also the tv menu will lock you out of several key picture adjustments during ps5 use with some adjustments to the firmware to fix these issues this tv would be nearly perfect i haven’t had an issue with this television like others from what i have read most issues are about gaming compatibility 47  10 severe issues with settings none remain when set audio passthrough is a nightmare motion settings are impossible to turn off for all hdr formats doesnt handle 24p content well from anything other than bluray source this is my fourth vizio tv and they just keep getting better bread brand and quality product i am very pleased with the quality and picture on this tv  i was disappointed that the streaming software runs at 720p since this is a 4k tv  i added a 4k firestick to resolve the issue  otherwise i am very happy with the design and function of this tv i bought it about three weeks ago and sometimes i am impressed with the crisp colors produced there are times not so much i  was watching something on netflix the other day and all the color except red looked good the red color was like pigmentated almost as if it were a hole where ever there was red i also noticed that when streaming sports live action it blurs a lot i  am not sure that isnt the feed but it is annoying extremely great controller its my first pro controller and i loved it the design and color make it complete had to get used to the paddles on the back but afterwards it made doing certain things in games easier beautiful controller a must have for any halo fan right joystick jumps and feels stuck sometimes paint in that same joystick that is gunmetal is gone and when the stick is rotated you can see the silver beneath wish i could have returned but with how these are gone everywhere i don’t know how i would have gotten another one… great design and awesome feel this controller would be perfect if not for the horrible quality control issue microsoft has on their controllers mine had stock drift a messed up button and a bent paddle so i’m waiting on a replacement fingers crossed a controller worthy of a spartan youll never play the same ever again with interchangeable thumbsticks dpad and mappable paddles youll be unstoppable in any engagement happy to add this to the halo collection she’s a beauty solid feeling controller love the design and halo theme of it multiple parts that can be swapped comes with an in game code that gives a weapon charm best controller ever toss a halo infinite skin on it makes it that much better recommend to anyone thumbstick issues straight out of box had to send back to microsoft to exchange for working one after that it’s wonderful more of a quality control issue on microsoft’s end than gamestops fault however when i reached out to gamestop about the purchase i was told they didn’t have any to replace it with just a general pain in the butt just for me to get a working product that i paid a lot of money for typical classic nintendo fun challenging not very enjoyable from beginning to end absolutely super fun a lot of challenges and game time since i bought it i haven’t put it down not a hard game but a good one to relax and play after work if you like yoshi you can’t go wrong here game is a masterpiece and provides decent challenges for even the seasoned gamer more whimsical yoshi fun that innovates on the last game without changing what we know and love  a bit easy but still fun  heartwarming fun game but too short  beat the game after only three days of casual play yoshi’s crafted world is fun and a bit challenging  my 10yearold loves it and i can play it with him  yoshi really adorable game with an imaginative landscape this game is cute and colorful and fun for all ages collectibles could be a little more satisfying however it doesn’t ruin the game developers did a great job but the game should be priced about 20 lower a fun platformer with charming visuals interesting puzzles and a good level of difficulty an extremely fun game not only for my little sister but for me too easy enough for her to enjoy but it has some challenges that allows me to have fun as well oled makes a big difference in the sharpness of the picture and it can be watched from an angle  very happy with my new tv i bought the 55 for the bedroom and at this price you cant find a better oled im was a sony guy but now i dont have to pay the premium to be lol finally a company that is challenging the big dogs and winning\\r\\nthe picture is beyond amazing os is smooth and video games look so darn good im buying the 65 for the front room next week i realize visio is new to oled and this is their first go at them  that being said this tv has potential and i knew saving money over lg would come with some growing pains i’ve experienced several anomalies that required a power cycle to correct some of those issues were sound no video on all inputs including ota  web channels syncing with true 120fps 4k sources \\r\\n\\r\\ni’d love to be able to recommend merely because of the picture and viewing angles alone truth is because of the issues at present with the firmware i just wouldn’t recommend now  i’m fairly certain those issues will be ironed out and i’ll do a later review most likely recommending this tv some features are missing and broken but when it works its great i’ve had this tv for almost 2 months and completely happy with the performance and picture i’m happy that i made this choice i sincerely hope this product lasts more than 15  20 years great picture lack of updates need support for 1440p and vrr 4k 120 also android fully baked in this tv is my first oled  the picture is breathtaking but the television itself has some problems  sometimes the television will not connect to the smart cast sometimes the tv will not even power on without having to pull the power plug and plugging it back in but overall i am happy with this television we have been promised all these things to be fixed and a future firmware update fingers crossed i was a bit nervous buying this set being that vizo just started making oleds i can tell you know after i have it in my house it is beautiful i can not believe the qualitly of the picture i have this set  in my main room and we have a gaming 4k tv on the same wall side by side this display makes the other 4k look cheap btw the other set is a high end display made for gaming\\r\\n\\r\\ni am so glad i gave it a chance so glad i decided to spend more to get the oled picture is the brst this is my second series 2 elite controller the first worked perfectly but this one looked so awesome that i had to have it the only issue is that the r thumbstick is a little sticky when pushing to the l no other direction only the left it is like there is a bit of resistance i have to push through before it releases and goes to the left my first elite series 2 controller doesnt have this issue it hampers fps games a little but not terribly otherwise a great controller and terrific looking product if your a halo fan im just a little bummed about the aiming thumbstick being slightly off the elite series 2 was already the best xbox controller now has an amazing look controller is awesome but my y button doesnt work all the time its very frustrating work as great as the original series 2 elite controller but that halo detail it was great to find a code inside that gives you a weapon charm that look exactly like the controller beautiful controller if at all possible why not buy the limited edition controller for a small amount more im a huge halo fan so getting an extra controller in this caliber of beauty was an easy choice for me elite controllers are an amazing controller for sure which is part of why there is too many reasons to get this controller really like many elite 2 controllers this was totally unusable out of the box  stick drift was suuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuper bad love this controller the attention to detail is out of this world great elite controller for a supa halo fanvery stylish too very cool and feels really nice and comfortable in hands its absolutely beautiful great controller i loved yoshi’s wooly world but this game came across as very childish and no real goal that you are trying to reach theres so much replay value with this game\\r\\ngoing back and forth between each level finding every nook and cranny \\r\\nin between each secret is so satisfying awesome game  little less challenging but that doesnt take away from the enjoyment of the game  highly recommend if your into yoshi island style games great game but kind of easy compared to yoshi’s island single player is tons of fun nothing sticks out as being bad other than being a little too easy for mature gamers coop is a jumbled mess of accidentally getting  stuck on people and losing your eggs unpredictably pretty fun typical yoshi game that offers more variety than usual still not yoshi’s island levels but pretty good nonetheless worth my money once you get past the cuteness factor of the game youll find a very fun gameplay experience controls seem very responsive and the 2 player mode is loads of fun and laughs great game to introduce a young child to gaming a great addition to the yoshi themed game library i havent been a huge fan of the series since it is a easier version a mario title but this game has been surprisingly fun it’s so cute i love yoshi  this version is built using craft materials and can get quite challenging  i love how detailed the graphics are fun fun fun great game and fun but unlocking different types of yoshi’s with yarn in the last game was a lot better than the costumes concept got my package installed it and got a steam powered program that starts itself every time i start my computer no option to turn that off and emediately takes me to thier online site with only options to buy games the was no game on the disk no information saying that it is an online game only no information saying it is even an online game on thier site i tried to check out the forums registering for thier forum kept takeing me to other sites these other sites required me to reister this repedative nonsence went on for 4 diff registration that finnaly returned me to the steam forums unfortunately i still wasnt allowed to access thier forums  no tech support no contact information no game no reason to even consider getting this product i own both supreme commander and forged alliance and find both games superb when i head there was a supreme commander 2 coming out of course i ran right out and got it i can honestly say this is one of the worst war games period my reasons include the fact you must unlock a lot of stuff to even consider playing the quick battles theres only 6 maps yes i said 6 the fact you cant even choose what side you want to be on until you unlock the ability and the worst part is you cant even see a simple overview of the maps when you are selecting them your basically better off throwing darts at your comp screen to decide what your gonna do rather than actually getting to decide anything at all about the battle ahead the point im making here is dont waste your money this game isnt even worth getting if it cost 250 played it today and ive never played a better rts im lovin it every step of the way and although its a little bit more cartoonish than the last one its still definatly a fun epic story lined game it beats aoe uaw and matches etw and cc i really love playing it and my slightly old system can handle it perfectly i was a little disappointed i though the requirements would be a little higher and i definatly see a decrease in the quality overall 8 out of 10 awesome game right now im a little concerned with the new unit the cybranasourus rex yeh i probably spelled that wrong it seemed a little like an out of place character to be put in the game its still a pretty cool unit and theres so much more upgrade the most important is the eco that they had the last one sucked and was full of glitches this one is much more stable its brings the good parts of halo wars and not the sucky parts because seriously halo wars sucked buy now the frist two games of this year that i was waiting for were supreme commander 2 and cc4 both are god awful supreme commander 2 is missing the best elements and nuances of its two predecessors i actually think that ta was the best of them all sad that games just get worse and worse as they come out with new titles what happened to the unit types there is not nearly as many unit types as sc or ta plus what happened to the recycling of plants and rocks the environmental resources you could live off until you got your resource production up and running and why are there so few multiplayer maps  i have an idea take the total annihilation engine give it some new graphicsnew sound a new story line and new unit types and dont change anything else dont know what the other guys here are talking about the game is great ya sure they took out some of the things the sup com pros loved but the thing is more people want to play rts so you cant expect a newbie to grasp every concept of the game unlike the pros if they left some of the things from the old sup com in it would be so unbalanced it wouldnt been as fun to play for the newbies  alright so lets get down to buisness the storyline is great and the graphics blow sup com 1s out of the water while supporting older computers that dont have as good of processors or graphics card win win situation at least thats what i think and that is why youre here isnt it    they added a new research screen to simplify it and added a whole bunch of new features like building add ons and new experimentals fyi to all aion illuminate fans they dont have naval anymore i know ouch right well i think well live  on to sound they did a really good job with the music this time its about 10 times better than sup com 1 and the sound effects really match up and exceed what you think they will sound like when lets say someone gets blown up by a nuke or someones commander goes into meltdown  for all those hard core gamers out there the 10 hour battles have gone away i know sad right well they replaced with a shorter even fiercer model of online game play that really seems to fit and when i mean shorter i mean average of two hours you can still build those big armies just faster one thing i wanna finish up with is the interface they kept a lot of the interface from sup com 1 and fa but also added the research screen which i talked about earlier it works like this you need research points to buy any sort of research upgrades and those research points automatically come along but you can build research facilities that increase the speed at which you get them you can spend research points on things like personal shields for your units or new buildings sight upgrades radar upgrades and new schematics for buildings and units big fyi for all those 360 gamers lookin at this the 360 version of this game is just as good if not better than the pc version make no mistake  this is supreme commander lite it almost feels like a very weak demo of supcom 1 but worse even with the new research trees youll still end up with no where near the amount of units to choose from that you had with supcom 1 and its tiers yeah sometimes the tiers were annoying to work through and it took far too long in most instances to get anywhere close to maximizing your factions potential in a single match in the first one  but this sequel has completely gutted it altogether youll likely end up mashing your mouse button or hotkey to churn out more of the exact same units over and over and over again because theres barely anything to choose from for unit diversity the game requires the steam client and an internet connection just to play while its true that most people these days have an internet connection its a rather unfortunate decision not only because youre excluding gamers but also because of potential happenstance scenarios steam goes down sorry youre out of luck a few years down the road and something else happenssuch as one of the companies going out of the business or whatnot and you cant go back to play it for old times sake again out of luck move to an area with limited connectivity same thing i wish developers would stop going with this route as its very shortsighted the graphics are significantly worse than the first one even on the highest settings there are only small maps and no larger maps to choose from in the first version you had a large selection of maps in supcom2 there are around 1015 and all of them are the same size pretty much i want to be clear one more time about the gameplay here this is not a merely different approach im pretty openminded and ill try just about anything this is a gutted approach to the first versions gameplay it takes many of the great features out and doesnt replace them  it does away with them altogether fewer units with no tiers or variety smaller selection of maps with almost no size difference in any worse graphics weak experimental units gameplay consists primarily of unit churning and zerg tactics i gave this game the benefit of the doubt because the first one was so great please dont make the same mistake i did do not buy this game if you like multiplayer or lanparties add this on to the list because you get a lot of fun in that little box there are many naysayers but i really dont know what the heck they are talking about graphics are great simple neat menu intense tugofwar games because its hard to dominate players that are sneaky it runs great on both my desktops and even my laptop so if you have a decent machine you can easily run this game because its not demanding at all very fun to play against you friends and the online is pretty intense single player story is good and easy to get into because you dont need to have played the originals to understand whats going on or anything as of right now you can save  if you buy it which makes it even more worth the money 1010 pick one up maybe ill play against ya there were so high hopes for this game as sc 1 and fa had left me hungry for more games like ta yet unfortunately the wait would lead to disappointment for those who enjoyed the similarities between ta and sc1 will be the biggest disappointment here the economy of the previously mention games is utterly gone no worrying about balancing energy usage and mass income with building and firing weapons its all been removed its now a simple straight up build up army build base defenses go conqueror enemy also gone are the tech levels and weaker starting units and teching up instead its replaced by research points that gradually come in much like all the other resources  without that element nothing really stood out in the game without the challenging economy the campaign portion of the game becomes simple build defenses build army repair defenses occasionally attack enemy musically nothing really stood out there may of been a couple times when i stopped to notice it but again nothing inspiring storyline it also seems kinda lacking it comes off like a final fantasy storyline mashed into brief conversations between 18 missions there just simply is not enough there to make a great story which once again left me greatly disappointed graphically the game was nice and the small scale compared to sc1 meant i could actually stay somewhat zoomed in to actually see the units and not just commanding by click on the small icons the movies were decent just way to few of em to tell a good story the game controls fairly well being rather simple game now its easy to pick up and get right into those with sc1 knowledge will have no trouble picking it up as the mechanics are still basically identical to the first those used to starcraft or cc type games might take a bit longer but overall its not a hard game to get into or to start playing the game probably has some strengths in multiplayer as the unit balance does seem good but i have not done any of that yet overall sc2 is not a bad game everything seems to work the game loaded smoothly the game had no noticle lag or slowdowns but there is just nothing in it that simply makes it stand out the game itself was fun to play through and i did enjoy the limited story and i may still by the sequel when it comes out of course the ending had a cliff hanger for a sequel what game doesnt do that no a days yet this probably wont be a game i will touch all to often again now that i have beaten it my suggestion is wait for the price to drop on this one if you simply want to see the continued storyline from the first as the game offers very little of anything else to draw players away from other games first there was total annihilation superb deep endless strategy constantly evolving hundreds of different units quick to learn hard to master then supreme commander and forged alliance made total annihilation ta larger with a better ai beautiful graphics and much of the same elements that made ta great  then supreme commander 2 what the hell happened here you took almost everything that made the first two stand alone and dominate and tossed it out the window my only guess is you tried to dumb this game down to the likes of a cc or a craft game so it could appeal to the zerg boys probably thanks to squares involvement really chris taylor how much did it cost to convince you to kill your baby graphics went from scifi futuristic to cartoonish threw out the unique resource allocation and made it a click and buy system with a research resource which is another craft game move that sucks took out almost 60 of the different units in the game an dumbed base creation and defense down to arrow towers craft again all the maps appear to be zergrush maps threw out the tier system sheesh i can go on and on but i wont bottom line if you loved what made total annihilation and supreme commander unique and fun you will hate and loath this game as i did however if you owned any craft game or cc and thought the above mention games were too complex strategic and epic for you then give supreme commander 2 a try  you should feel right at home in this slop show okay so yeah its pretty much like the first two in the basics the three factions the basic units some of the basic units are straight out of supcom 1 and forged alliance and one big war on almost everything else its completely revamped upgrading has been replaced with researching which really adds more hassle to the game but also adds a new era of customization because instead of just going up levels 1 2 3 and experimental you can have multiple branches of different customizations depending on your favored style of play you can even simply upgrade what units you have instead of the old send oldies to suicide to make room for the new guys strategy actually it is better to keep the oldies instead of suiciding them because the longer they stay on the battlefield the deadlier they become thanks to experience now the muchfamed and even moreso whinedabout economy that made supcom 1 and forged alliance so famous or infamous lol has been drastically simplified which on one side makes the game easier to play and a lot less worrisome but on the other side it makes the game harder because now you can no longer makebuild unitsstructures without first having the resources available instead of just having that drastic omnislowdown from the first two the epic battlefields of the first two games are well gone no more will you have the massive wave upon wave of units swarming towards your opponent across miles of territory because theyll now practically be right at your back door or front door side door or wherever they are positioned on the map thats one drawback but makes for much more interesting heated and fasterpaced battles the graphics are outstanding so detailed you can almost see the individual bolts and weld lines on your acu in closeup mode and no more resourceclogging like fa was notorious for the game runs smooth as silk if you have good enough graphics cards my dual ati asus eah4860s can barely run fa smoothly on even low graphics but they effortlessly controlled sc2 on the highest graphics settings i havent gotten too far into the storyline yet but it seems to be good so far you actually play named characters in this game instead of the generic commander of the other two it looks like an interesting storyline and the voice acting is decent the voices fit the characters allinall this game is not its brothers it doesnt have that epic scale quality to it nor the complexity of the resource system that complexity is now embedded in the research system its beautifully redone and expertly made i just wish they could have increased the epic scales to keep with supcom tradition i bought this to play my ps5 and not only thengames look great but movies too waiting for the firmware update then i can update to 5 stars great tv with all up to date technology from dolby vision and atmos hdr10  etc perfect for gaming hdmi 21 i trust in vizio products i bought a 60 in 2012 and still running 2021 i purchased the 65 inch oled 1 week ago  the tv is beautiful  deep blacks  colors are great right out of the box  you will have to do nothing to get this tv to look great  i wish they had offered a 75 inch oled but i am sure this will come  picture processing is good as well  i recommend this tv to my friends i picked this oled vizio for the intensely beautiful picture and i have not been disappointed its incredible for gaming on my playstation and watching vivid shows problems turning oled tv on so i returned it and got another one  the screen had a green tint to it so i returned it and got my money back plus the vrr didn’t work i love how skinny it is and how much cooler it runs the picture is awesome gorgeous unit  wonderful image oodles of features and an asking price that’s within  reach of the average consumer what more can you ask for i’ve always liked visio my first 50” had one backlight diode burn out after 7yrs heavy use replaced with 50” nano visio i was happy with the upgrade figured i could get a 55” within the space constraint i had got this one as open box and wow the picture pops of vibrancy and consistent brightness i got this tv 3 weeks ago and so far i love it easy to operate easy to hook up other devices to it great tv beautiful controller i only changed the dpad and still calibrating but it is perfect glorious equipment for slaying all who oppose spartan 117 i got this as a gift for my boyfriends birthday i don’t play xbox and i’ve never played halo but i was completely blown away by this controller it feels amazing i think the way it was designed was incredible and totally worth the money my bf loved it and made me consider becoming an xbox gamer this controller is amazing and beautiful i’m glad to have it love the elite series 2 controller and with a halo paintjob its almost perfect i kinda wish this would have included the updated series xs share button but thats a minor complaint with the latest xbox update its now able to quickly connect to 2 paired devices which is probably the best feature of the updated series xs controllers so im happy with that if you love halo and were thinking about getting an elite controller this is the one you want its similar to the regular elite it just feels lighter quality feels slightly better and it looks so hecking cool in person so many details that the pictures dont do it justice performs like you expect the elite series 2 to do so but with the added benefit of looking wicked by far the coolest controller i’ve owned hopefully it will keep nice and not develop rub marks from fingers i had the series one which still works great but decided to upgrade for the better paddles and internal battery i am very pleased with this product not only because its halo but it does feel like a substantial improvement over the previous generation im still trash though great for halo fanatic  it weighs a lot more than your standard controller  bought as christmas present for the halo fanatic  splurged on the 2 year warranty just in case too it’s a great looking controller but without the console to match it will be lonely very hard to pick up the items you want unless you want to pay ridiculous prices from scalpers who seem to get these items with ease but still a great looking controller pretty simple game great for younger games way too many things to have to collect good game kinda on the kid side of game my kids like it game is great for parents to play with their kids very fun as someone playing through sekiro this was a nice pallet cleanser i had an open mind when deciding to play this game and after clearing the first world it just wasnt for me compared to woolly world this game was lacking in several departments the music was repetitive the skill level was far too low even for just the first world and the game doesnt reward you nearly as much as woolly world did in terms of amiibo id recommend this for diehard yoshi fans or kids age 5 through 9 the kids 6 and 3 love it and i love that they can play together my 3 year old doesn’t know what she’s doing but my 6 year old helps her yoshi’s crafted world game is also fun for parents  simply amazing my son and i are loving this game its so creative and well thought out so much fun for all ages we have from age 4 to 34 who love to play bought this game for my son but i enjoy playing it too my family and i really enjoy using the nintendo switch and i must say this is by far one of the best games ever super cute yet challenging at times there’s a gum ball where you can insert coins and collect costumes there’s also a flip side to the game where you interact and catch little puppies just when you think you’ve completely the level there’s other mini challenges like a scavenger hunt you should purchase this game you won’t regret it so far ive enjoyed playing sc2 there are a handful of differences between it and its predecessors both good and bad the battles arent as big as the ones from supreme commander but they are still brilliant the new research is fun as well as expanding buildings with tactical add on pieces even if they are minor ones and the fact you can replace your acu without permanently losing it now and the new upgrades for the acu and units most of the cons ive found so far are requiring steam the smaller battlefields and other minor problems which may be fixed eventually in updates it lacks the feeling of the original game but its still fun to play id recommend to everyone that they try the demo on steam first before deciding overall i rate this 7 out of 10 first off you need to have steam installed on your computer thanks for the headsup on this square you buy a hard copy of the game but then have to log in to steam to download it from their serversreally some people are showing a 9 hour wait time to be able to play again really second they destroyed the economy and the basic gameplay of the original game and its expansion none of it even matters any more its just a zerg fest most people think its due to the console being added to this title and thereby attempting to expand their market they broke what made the first game such a huge hit gone are the days of epic battles for my 3rd point maps are now 5kmx5km way too small fourth you cant saveload in skirmish play soooo if you have to leave in the middle of a longer lasting game not real sure how this will happen being that everything is so smallbut want to give them the benefit of the doubt for future content added updates too bad cant save fifth the voice acting and story line for the campaign is just plain stupid i guess i could go on but im sure ive expressed my opinion enough for folks to understand where im coming from this is just insulting to people who have been really looking forward to this title there was a reason the first game was as much of a success as it was well square enix effectively threw that out the window and scrapped it all good job i haven’t used it yet but the unboxing was amazing this is a really nice looking controller it really feels right this controller is gawgeous i love the cosmetic design of it the rubberized grips the back paddles and the accessories it comes with its own wireless charger interchangeable analog thumb sticks and dpad the design is reflective of master chiefs armor i love it amazing controller well worth the money solid feel and looks fantastic i want to buy a second one already it came broken… stick drift on the right thumb stick right out of the box quality feel and looks awesome also arrived early on the 15th was shipped next day air exactly what i was looking for in a controller and the halo fan in me loves the halo theme on the controller its good just sucks how the bumpers dont like to work sometimes its vrandnew beautiful controller just need the console to go with it gamestop packaged it well and sent it super fast it actually arrived prior to release date now i just need the console great controller that feels better than the standard ones paddles are useful in gameplay and the color scheme is great you also recieve a code for the controller as an accessort in halo infinite high quality packaging nice dock and very long usbc cord even the packaging was superb everything was secure to make sure nothing would be damaged in shipping it is very true to the pictures and works great i had no problems after mounting the tv and the set up was a breeze had this tv for a month now and its worth every penny dont listen to all the negative youve been hearing about vizio they have done a really good job with all their new high end televisions i just bought this item and am so excited to watch sports and movies on it compared to the lg cx and sony a8h the picture quality is way better than sonys oled  those reviews online are biased and not accurate imo  not a fan of smartcast yet over android tv tv has some firmware glitches  sound from tv speakers is ok not as nice as the sonys however this is a one heck of an oled with no black crush we were looking at one but am the type of people who wi only purchase an item like this when the one we have goes bad now the old one will go into the basement the best “american product 100 costumer satisfacción  guaranteed i bought this tv and set it up at home but it was quite obvious to me that the feed i was watching on this tv in the store was optimized for the tv for better picture at home however it was grainy and looked like motion flip art like the one you draw and flip through the tv was so hot i thought i bought a hp laptop this was my wife’s and my anniversary gift to each other we regularly watch movies and we are amazed at how the cinematographer’s vision is articulated with this tv i’ve had this tv for about a month of movies and gaming couldn’t be happier the image on the tv is fantastic and the sleek slim design gives it that pop aesthetic that the “world” within the tvs borders is almost lifelike to the touch great controller only wish i had the halo xbox to go with it this is the elite series 2 but they did an excellent job with the halo theme the best controller with now an awesome new paint job fun game really nice visuals its an easier platform so more people can enjoy it but seasoned gamers will like the collectables available which give replay value to the game and a bit more challenge one of must fun nintendo games ive played in a long time nintendo does it again with sweet crisp graphics and my kids love yoshi if you enjoyed wooly world youll love crafted world this game is a great addition to the yoshi series and adds fun mechanics unique to this game it does have a 2 player mode and would be fun to play with a less experienced game overall presentation is great control is simple and platforming is fun nintendo game prices hardly comes down so if price is a factor preowned with powerup rewards discount really helps mitigate the cost and maybe invest those points either way top notch yoshi game and a must play for yoshi fans great fun reminds me of yoshis world from when i was a kid love the extras each level has not a fan of yoshi smash level but in general love the game this is a proper modern evolution of the yoshi formula  giving you access to the fore and background when throwing eggs adds an extra dimension of exploration and the collectibles are definitely worth getting  the flower requirement to progress to new areas is rarely difficult to fulfill but it emphasizes the collection aspect in a game that gives you a lot of tools to do so and is chockfull of stuff to see  if youve ever loved playing a platformer you need to play this game a few weeks before the game came out i downloaded the demo just to see if my six year old son was going to play it and he and when the game came out i got it for his bday and he have not put it down great game side scrolling puzzle solver better than i anticipated and can’t put it down there is a gum ball machine for different costumes addicting haha yoshi’s crafted world is an amazing game it is beautifully designed and appropriately challenging the ability to play two players is also great as my wife and i like to game together i would definitely recommend it to anyone who owns a switch especially those who want to play some couch coop bought this for a christmas gift for my husband and myself \\r\\nits greatcolor sound and price we have had visos in the past and have been very pleased got this in time to have it up on the wall christmas day the family loved it the app sometimes glitches green and i need to power cycle yhr tv to work right also i cant seem to download other apps that seems to be essential example crunchyroll bought the tv right before christmas  just amazing clarity and color excellent picture quality and very easy to set up about 10 years ago i purchased my first vizio 54 just months after its release  it held up well until one day it just didnt turn on  lights on but no one is home type of  so in the spirit of the shopping season i jumped at a another brand new vizio product this oled 55  \\r\\nwith its easy to mount easy setup the show just begins with its amazing ink black levels beautiful imagery from its 1080p to its upscaling to 4k to its true 4k glory \\r\\nout of the box it had a firmware update and then a week later another  the 2nd was a bit rude as it occurred in the middle of a show without warning\\r\\ni am using the amazing oled with a brand new 4k reciever with earc  so everying goes through the amplifiter through a high end hdmi arc certified cable to the tvs hdmi 1 earc  most days its running fantastic and smooth as expected  although the tv has 2 behaviors that need adjusting not sure if its me or a firmware update  they are the screen goes blank when new input isnt supplied ie your movie is paused and you need to press the ok on the remote to wake it up  having your show resume doesnt do it  and the 2nd is that a few times now the tv just doesnt see any input on hdmi 1 when clearly the amplifier is sending signal  looking forward to a future firmware to make this tv absolutely perfect very nice picture nice sound but the oled effect can cause severe headaches in certain people  there should be some form of medical warning and available solutions i purchased this 3 weeks ago and i love the picture quality after contacting the boae surround  system its like you your in the movies great job vizio i just bought this tv did not plan on spending this much this tv is worth every penny the color is so vivid model is sleek and so much thinner than led i bought this one month ago and im glad i did this model my son loves this game like super smash bros with kung fu panda characters i got the game through ps plus and i was skeptical at first however after playing it with my friends for a little bit it was some of the most fun id had playing a game ever its no citizen kane but it does its job as a fun simple fighting game well we bridges this for christmas for my nephew everyone had a good time playing i bought this game for my grandson and he absolutely no loves this game i bought this game for my daughter because she’s very competitive we thought it was family friendly but it’s very hard to learn different moves i had a hard time playing it also and i’m good at playing games  it’s not the easiest game to play and in my opinion its not for kids either my 5 ear old loves this game  controls are simple and each fight location has their own challenges this game deserves 10 stars but i was only allowed to give 5 it is definitely better than smash i think it should win game of the year i sew the trailer and it was ok not the best and characters were alright i heard that there was a lag in the game  but over all i give it 2 stars another super smash clone but horrible one at that i wouldnt buy this game if it was free i dislike the games audio and lasting appeal so bad my children couldnt even bear it i have a lg oled tv and i wish i waited for this tv im very pleased i hope the update will fix the power issues i have to turn on multiple time before the picture would stay on i’ve had my vizio 55” oled for about 3 weeks clear picture from any place in the room color is so much better than the tv i replaced which was a vizio led 55” tv other than the smartcast being a bit buggy the picture is spot on i have been facing multiple issues from the time i got this tv\\r\\n1 airplay doesnt work 90 of the times unless i go into admin  privacy and reboot the tv\\r\\n2 even after reboot it doesnt work 50 of the times i will have to reboot more than once\\r\\n3 same issue with chrome cast as well\\r\\n4 tv screen turns off while mirroring screen via my ipad every 1015 minutes\\r\\n5 while connected to hdmi port when im in zoom meeting using tv as external monitor it throws message no signal detected and turns off tv after few minutes while im still in between the meeting\\r\\n6 home button doesnt work 50 of the times unless tv is rebooted have had it for two weeks perfect picture and great design loving it so far great price for all the features and crystal clear picture just wish it had a hbo max app preloaded in the main menu but very easy to cast from my smart phone or ipad to the tv vizio has stepped up their game going head to head with the lg and samsung on this one finally someone has made an oled tv that i could afford well worth the price i was sold on the fact that you can see definition anytime there is a night scene and it’s not just blurry the colors are incredibly vivid even with a standard hd signal i also love that it has screen mirroring for my iphone along with a bunch of other viewing options just had this installed yesterday the bestbuys geek squad also installed a new sound bar the picture is amazing and we are looking forward to seeing many of our favorite shows in a whole new light the remote will take getting used to but well learn i wish there was an app for pbs installed well have to see it by airplay when the game trailer is a rip off of super smash bros you know its going to flop the chrachter selection is poor and the gameplay is choppy i need my 20 back i really enjoy playing this game it is fun and enjoyable for all ages the game is cute but hasn’t held my 6yearold son’s attention he has beat donkey kong country super mario odyssey and supernmario deluxe he only played a couple of levels of yoshi and hasn’t went back to it over a week later this game is similar to yoshis woolly world  the levels are made of things like cardboard ribbon straws and construction paper  each level can be played in a normal mode or a reverse mode  there are cute costumes you can unlock using coins that you collect throughout the levels  its a perfect game for parents to play with their kids got this for my 2 sons they love  have a lot of fun playing it together the game is wonderful to play through fun levels extras cute outfits and even an easy mode for younger players just dont try to get everything or you wont have a good time this game is super fun and adorable \\r\\nlove how everything looks like crafts \\r\\nas a yoshipoochy fan i enjoy the yoshi games this seems more like a kids game but everyone will enjoy it’s very entertaining but not very stressful it looks so cheerful and colorful and who doesn’t like yoshi with wings fun to play while letting those who want a challenge to be able to spend time to complete the game while its easy enough for children to play that doesnt take away from how fun it is for the whole family levels have a decent amount of replayability and its decently challenging in a casual way  would recommend to anyone fun game for kids and adults more relaxed then mario and very kid friendly bought this on black friday after reviewing 45 other led tvs  im so glad that i did  the oled experience is simply stunning  my previous tv was a panasonic plasma which i held onto as long as i could because i didnt want to give up those deep blacks and contrast  this tv has such great contrast  for example when you watch a dark scene with isolated bright spots like lamps office windows etc it will blow you away how bright those spots are against the deep black surroundings  the panel is made by lg and you can get the same performance for a lot less money i bought this a couple of weeks ago  easy to install and set up  fantastic picture  we love the smart cast and look forward to our elderly relatives coming over  we can facetime our loved ones and airplay it on the tv and everyone will be able to see i love the tv but am on the fence on returning it or not fix everything people are complaining about also 1440p needs to be 120hz theres no reason why it shouldnt be get it together please i have a long time history of purchasing vizio television and each time of purchase i have upgraded having said that vizio has shifted in the best way awesomeness i had a vizio 65 led tv that i thought was still pretty good but i was intrigued by oled the set i bought looked great in the store and even better at home and thats on everything not just 4k streams and dvds great picture quality and very easy to set up would highly recommend this is the best tv ive ever owned the picture quality is amazing i dont have enough words to express how happy i am with this tv bought the oled visio over the samsung q series very happy except sometimes the input switches from one to another happen 2 times i set this tv up less than a month ago and still going through all the apps and everything it can do i really want to love this tv the picture quality is amazing the smart cast interface is solid and its all packeged under an beatable price \\r\\n\\r\\nhowever there are a few headaches that is keeping me from recommending it the first is the hdmi 21 port the oled h1 has 4 hdmi ports 1 is earc awesome 4 is a regular 20 works for most devices you want to plug in to get 1080p or 4k but port 2 and 4 are the new hdmi21120hz ports and they are currently practically useless if you want to get 4k and dolby 51 on them they are currently not compatible with the playstation 5 and it is super buggy with the new google chromecast with google tv it will not get 51 audio with the new chromecast and to get 4k i have to manually switch the input from auto to 14 then back to 21 this is very frustrating \\r\\n\\r\\nthis is still a really good tv but the growing pains right now would keep me from recommending it to others im coming from a 2018 vizio p series really fun 2 player game that seems well balanced it looks great and feels rewarding to go collect stuff its really nice that the game seems to avoid many the coop deaths that im used to in new super mario bros u deluxe and yoshis woolly world we jump or egg each other and fall to our deaths its a deep 2d game with an interesting spin on yoshi island nintendo always amazes me with the great graphics with thier titles gameplay is smooth and overall fun is better with my wife simple super fun platformer that’s perfect for kids or couples to play great game for small children and entertaining for adults as well great games for kids and parents to play together amazing game graphics are too cool theyre made out of cardboard bottles etc and the two player is fantastic highly recommend i bought this game for my 8 yr old autistic daughter and she absolutely loves this game it is her first video game bought soley for her and she just took right to it with no issues at all for other games she has played it has been difficult for her to grasp what goes on on the screen and how that associates with what she is doing on the controller such as constantly running into walls on mario kart because it was difficult to for her to figure out how to steer but no such issues with this game and she absolutely loves it its sooo cute the levels are adorable but still challenging enough if you want to get 100 my new goto game for destressing 3 this game is super fun and brings out the kid in me each level has multiple challenges making the game seem like neverending fun the voices are adorable and the choices are plentiful great game highly recommended it’s a really relaxed game that you can pick up and play anytime the graphics are amazing and unique overall i’d definitely recommend this game for anyone who is a yoshi fan me and my 5 year old really enjoy this game if you enjoy the mario games this is one you can add to that list an incredibly fun sequel to yoshis woolly world  amazing graphics the game is fun and the graphics look great some levels are hard for a children’s game but over the game is great this game is a crafted masterpiece the level of detail is gorgeous gameplay is a throwback to the classics while maintaining a modern feel the two player mode is unique and available right at the start the game is great for all ages and incredible for a good time or a family game night i highly recommend this game entertaining game for all ages  the levels are relatively easy to pass but become challenging if you are the type of gamer who goes for 100 completion  the colorful graphics also help add to the fun nature of the game great game for me and my kids ages 6 4 and 1 they can actually play it on their own and love it cute game just as fun if not more than wooly world was whimsical lighthearted platformer densely packed stages filled with collectibles secrets and uniquely beautiful art designs  tons of content adds replay value to keep you playing long after finishing the six to eight hour main adventure definitely a worthwhile purchase especially if you plan to play the often chaotic but always entertaining simultaneous two player coop mode if you like the gameplay of yoshi’s island the art style of yoshi’s woolly world then yoshi’s crafted world is the gamefor you and the family sort of short aimed more towards kidsbut if you love yoshi and want something to sit back before bed and relax and play this is your game  so charming so chill so yoshi just bought tv a while back moved to the new house and now it wont turn on this tv replaced a smaller older vizio i bought back in 201112 was not looking for an oled but went with it since the price was so good i could not be happier the picture is great everything we watch has looked amazing on it the picture is exceptionally light and bright where it needs to be but the infinite dark reminds you it is an oled this tv is in a class of its own about my tv last month i love it love everything about it i am pleased with the quality of this unit best tv i have ever owned oled is off the charts the colors pop and deep rich blacks im creeping up on retirement and i didnt want to buy a quality tv on a fixed budget the picture and the vizio surround surround speakers are excellent  response to the remote for adjusting sound level is sluggish and remote has few features compared to other systems for the picture this has been great for the price the reason i give it 3 stars though is because i am very critical of when the operating system is not “snappy”  for a modern tv losing of apps and maneuvering through the ui should be quick while this is better than my old samsung tv os i still expected it to be quicker   i also hate h to r banner style at the top my first choice should be to pick an app rather than some curated selection when so turn on the tv i haven’t been able to find a feature to turn it off its better quality than i imagined amazing tv\\r\\nmy only critique is that i wish it performed  a 1440p resolution everything else is great so far i love it the new tech for video games is awesome this is my first oled tv and i am loving it i’ve been using vizio tvs for years and have never disappointed me this one is super fast and there’s no lag when selecting through the apps the lag is something i hated on my previous vizio tvs bu that’s gone now now just bring hbo max one thing i don’t like and hope that it’s fixed in a future software update is that currently 4k120hz hdmi ports don’t work on the ps5 fix that and this tv will be perfect its comfortable and works great my only frustration is that it doesnt seem to allow button remapping i can set it up on the switch and the buttons are changed on the switch paddles but this controller doesnt allow the changes not sure if this is a switch issue or the controller otherwise it is great this review was collected as part of a promotion this controller was bought for the intent to enhance the switch experience and to add some more skill to certain games the case did arrive slightly damaged the inside plastic was torn but the product remained in perfect condition it is light but doesnt mean it isnt quality it brought a different set of skills to games that required more then a small handheld joystick a little throwback to the classic design of a controller this review was collected as part of a promotion received to try out on our gaming system and definitely enjoy it way better then the cord controller having wireless is more convient as you can move better and no worries about pulling a cord out of the system the over all grip is very comfortable and nice fitting not only is it convient comfortable but also comes designed with mario which is many favorites of alot of people alot of my family complement us on our new controller for the design and now wants one or something similar this review was collected as part of a promotion this controller was so eay to use and dits just right in my hand i love the colors it comes in and connects very easily this review was collected as part of a promotion i like having a controller to hold onto with the switch and this one gets the job done  set up was easy  the only downside is no rumble but the added buttons make up for it  the retro mario theme is an added bonus and loved by husband and son alike this review was collected as part of a promotion the design on this remote is so cool the batteries are the only drawback but that can be remedied by just buying rechargeable batteries which i would highly recommend this review was collected as part of a promotion this is a great controller for the nintendo switch it has a great mario design that my kids loved it was easy to set up and it being wireless was even better it seems to be very durable as well and good thing because my kids are super rough on things aspect controllers i will be purchasing a second one so both my kids have them to play with this review was collected as part of a promotion this is a review for the nintendo switch wireless game controller \\r\\n\\r\\ni like that this is wireless with sensors  so im not tied down with a cord  \\r\\n\\r\\nthis controller has bluetooth mappable buttons fully programmable and more  \\r\\n\\r\\nthe motion controls are awesome this is a smart product\\r\\n\\r\\nthis has a design that feels good in the hands it is not bulky or hard to work  \\r\\n\\r\\nmy nephews prefer this over the other wireless controller we have and they kind of fight over it  they really like the retro mario on the controller and make fun of me because it was brand new in my day  this is fun so id definitely recommend this product this review was collected as part of a promotion the pros feels almost identical to the official nintendo pro controller  \\r\\n\\r\\ni like the fact it uses double a batteries compared to an internal rechargeable battery\\r\\n\\r\\nthe added mappable buttons could come in handy even though i havent used those yet\\r\\n\\r\\nthe cost is much less than the nintendo pro controller \\r\\n\\r\\nthe cons\\r\\nslightly unconventional setup \\r\\nits not a problem though if you read the instructions \\r\\n\\r\\nits lighter in weight which makes me wonder about durability \\r\\n\\r\\nmakes a perfect 2nd controller for kids this review was collected as part of a promotion i have been using this controller for my nintendo switch for a couple of weeks now and am very happy with the overall performance of it it is very comfortable to hold and the buttons are set up perfectly  it being a bluetooth wireless controller is a huge plus the super mario bros design is my favorite though its very attractive and ive received so many compliments on it it’s not entry level friendly but can be very rewarding i struggled at first boy it was challenging but with lots of practice and doing tutorialstraining i managed to not come in 12th or 10th place i now place at about 6th or 4th boy does not wining  a race hurt but it’s the grind and constant improvement could lower the difficult and turn assist on but that would take the fun out of the challengei then went to youtube to see pro gamers struggling or flipping cars as well so that made me feel a little better too if your looking for a real rally experience buy dirt the handling on this game is cartoonish you cut and you get penalties total garbage very detailed graphics challenging driving and numerous course selections a lot of fun for multiplayer the only semi con is that it is difficult to select changes to your driving car but overall a must have simply gorgous to look at and play  it says pure simulator on the box for a reason  if you go in expecting anything less you will get plastasized good game need to spend some more time playing it this is a good one one of the best driving games ive played the career mode is a bit of a pain but still pretty cool the wrc 8 fia world rally championship is a great game to play the cars are awesome and the scenery is breathtaking theres so much to do i really have lots of fun playing it much improvement over the wrc 7 world rally championship they did a really nice job in putting this game together great game easy to pick up and play at home or on the go one of the absolute best in the yoshi franchise well worth the wait cant go wrong with yoshi cute detailed and fun you get what you see with this game i love it\\r\\n\\r\\ngreat sequel to wooly world super fun game that can be as easy or as challenging as you want it to be depending on if your thing is to 100 a game or not another quality release on the switch highly recommended not a heck of a lot wrong with this game i like to say this is the epitome of weaponized cuteness the designers did a fantastic job with level design it feels like they actually built every level in the game with cardboard and construction paper in reality and then put it into the game and they stick with that through the entire game the controls are tight and the yoshis are as adorable as ever\\r\\n\\r\\nthe addition of being allowed to manually aim your eggs removes some of the frustration that earlier titles had and there are collectible items in abundance for completionists that all said the game is not meant for those looking for a challenge i dont need dark souls levels of difficulty but at least some sort of resistance would have been nice levels can basically be run through rather blind if youre not hunting for every red coin or flower even the challenge levels at the end of the game dont really have much bite to them\\r\\n\\r\\nthe biggest hiccup in the game i think is the mini quests you get each level has multiple different set pieces that a robot will want you to collect the issue is you can only do one at a time so the game asks you to play through one level at least 6 or 7 times and it can get rather tedious at times my suggestion is that if you are collecting everything dont try to get it all at once because i assure you you will be back through that level multiple times\\r\\n\\r\\nin the end the game is a relaxing adventure through a handcrafted almost literally world that never fails to charm perfect for players of all ages but if youre looking for a challenge i would look elsewhere very cute and the right amount of challenges great game for all ages we love yoshi\\r\\nits a great game for kids and adults excellent game especially for kids and new gamers looking to learn but still complicated and fun enough for an experienced vet really boring and lackluster fun platforming but not much else good for kids not for adults cute game i can play with the family i love how interactive it is you can knock over things in the foreground and background this tv has been fantastic and especially since we recently purchased a 51 dolby surround system mandalorian looks and sounds amazing now after getting this tv \\r\\n\\r\\nthe one thing that would truly be the cherry on top would be to have a microphone on the remote control to search for a program like the roku’s do \\r\\n\\r\\noverall it is a good sized tv with an amazing picture well worth it super impressed with the clarity and color of the picture great picture and easy to use enjoy it very much bought for picture quality and i am not disappointed it is fabulous i am actually surprised at how wonderful the display is in my home very satisfied and would buy again if it goes on sale anytime soon i will buy another one for another room in my home i am really happy with my purchase visio knocked it out of the park with this one its a great tv this is my first oled and it works great with my xbox series x my only issue is that it keeps putting itself back on warm color temp very often bought this tv a couple of weeks ago to replace a five year old visio  our previous tv was top of the line back then240 refresh rate etc  this new tv is fantastic  what a picture  well worth it i bought the tv about a month ago and have never had as many problems with a tv in my life vizio has a reputable name so of course i wanted to give the oled a try day one when i got the tv home it wouldn’t power up so after plugging the tv up and unplugging it a few times i got it to power up the oled does have a beautiful picture but now every morning when i want to turn on the tv it won’t power up again i have to unplug the tv for 30 minutes every morning for it to come on now while i’m watching tv the sound just goes away at times and i have to reboot the tv sometimes 3 times before the sound comes back on at times the hdmi won’t recognize it has the cable or game system connected so i have to turn it off and on again when that happens this is just unacceptable from vizio i hear there will be firmware updates but how long will that take  i don’t know what to do should i return the tv and try another vizio oled or just stay clear of vizio because this is the beat quality they can produce right now i bought this tv several weeks ago and i couldnt be happier the difference between oled and anything else is astonishing highly recommended i’m having multiple issues with it tried to set it up with my xbox x series too play in 4k resolution but the screen goes black when i did change some settings to get the tv too play my xbox in 4k it wouldn’t turn back on after i had turned it off from playing i had to physically unplug and plug it back into the wall too got it too come back on this review was collected as part of a promotion this controller works great with our nintendo switch i love the fact that it is wireless and vibrates

another one so both of them can play together this review was collected as part of a promotion i just got the enhanced wireless controller for nintendo switch and i must say i was surprised with the quality of it  it definitely makes playing so much easier especially when it comes to certain games this review was collected as part of a promotion this is a wonderful remote it’s make playing the

anybody that has a nintendo switch this review was collected as part of a promotion this works perfectly and has alot of extra controls and features this review was collected as part of a promotion i love this remote it is easy to connect and use the remote itself is well made and comfortable to hold the fact that it is wireless is great and makes gaming more enjoyable it does take batteries but battery life is long it is a perfect remote for any gamer this review was collected as part of a promotion i received this controller to test out and review i suprised my 12 year old with it and he just loved it he loves that its wireless he said it was so cool that he wanted to get his friend one for christmas so this is definitely kid approved thank you for this opportunity you made one kid very happy this game is perfect for my first grader  she can play alone or we can add a yoshi for a level and i can play with her awesome game  amateur to intermediate skill level with a few hard levels but once you get to the end you’ll play like a pro this game is so cute easy and mellow this game can be played with up to two players my husband and i took turns playing with our 5yr old he loved it fun and easy though the sound track sounds very uninspired if only crafted worlds soundtrack could take note from yoshi story it’s a real fun and easy game to play i’m not sure if there’s a way to do increase difficulty since it only comes with two modes and i play classic regardless the battles are fun and if you want a game where you don’t have to think way to hard this is it i love the graphics and i love the creativity that goes into it a charming easy to play title thats perfect for young  kids overall great game interesting and has different elements than other yoshi games to date my son absolutely loves it they should know that it’s fun  cute  for all ages beautifully developed with great music it appears as only for kids but don’t be fooled this game has enough puzzles and the replay value is definatley there at first glance you would think this is a kid game and has no entertainment value for adults i will tell you first hand that is not the case with this game the visuals are stunning and there is plenty of action packed platforming for everyone where to start do not buy this tv for a next gen console you have to manually change the input setting from hdmi auto to hdmi 21 for the xbox to recognize the 4k  120hz if that wasn’t annoying enough the specs said allm hdr and vrr when you go to the tv info screen says no to hdr and vrr then proceeded to give the tv another chance by using the apps it offers what a joke the screen went green and kept flashing the picture i tried five to six apps all the same outcome finally on day three of owning it it quit showing the picture for the xbox to confirm it wasn’t the xbox series x i switched back to my samsung q70r tv which has a better picture and does everything but 4k  120hz abs is still to this day running fine needless to say i shouldn’t have bought a vizio in the first place like my gut told me i wasted my gas and time on this tv i bought this almost two weeks ago and next to my brothers lg oled it holds its own for the price as a pure oled screen this is the way to go but it’s not perfect which is to be expected for the price as a budget oled it’s native apps that don’t support the tv’s high resolution will have noticeable pixels and it’s already showing signs of oled burn in if you keep the same image on for more than one minute you should allow rest mode after 15 sec of inactivity i’m serious just be gentle with the tv and don’t forget to turn it off and you will get an amazing tv no other brand tv can compete with the quality and price of this tv for those having trouble gaming in 120hz you have to change the settings to 21 on your hdmi 2 i almost didnt buy because the reviews on gaming saying it wouldnt do 120hz at 4k but it absolutely will and the xbox verified that just change your settings to 21 the best picture quality on any tv ive ever owned truly amazing ive been looking at the new oled model tvs for a while and im so glad i finally purchased my very own oled 4k tv  the picture is incredible even if what youre watching isnt in high def  high def channels and movies look so good but the 4k programming is insanely sharp it looks as if youre actually there this was a great purchase perfect blacks and beautiful color reproduction i am impressed with the build quality and the attention to detailed such as the the wiring placement also the apps that’s included are amazing it also has apple tv the only thing missing is a voice search on the remote other than that great purchase and extremely happy so far so good  enjoying the difference that oled offers just picked this tv up a couple weeks ago did a lot of research thanks to youtube and saw that this was the tv to get for gaming a 120hrz vrr vrrhdr black screen but at 60htz it looks great vizio please fix\\r\\nthx\\r\\nxbox series x excellent tv beautifulpicture easy to use with enough extras  this review was collected as part of a promotion this is a great addition to our nintendo switch easy to set up and easy to use i highly recommend this review was collected as part of a promotion i got this for my son and grandson who play the switch together my son is an old school nintendo fan so when i saw this with the old graphics i got it immediately \\r\\nhe absolutely loves it it linked up easily and is user friendly \\r\\nhe loves the two on the fly buttons he can map to make his play more custom \\r\\ngreat controller  it did come with 2 double a batteries so was ready to go right out of the box \\r\\nthe bluetooth works smoothly with no delays this review was collected as part of a promotion my kids have been using this controller and they are very happy with it\\r\\nit seems to be very sturdy and super cute too this review was collected as part of a promotion i love this controller it is lightweight and fits nicely in my hands which are on the smaller size i like the fact that i can use my own aa batteries and not some odd size battery and i dont have to wait for it to recharge this makes for a quick change of batteries and back to my games quickly the only downside is it does not have rumble but thats not really that big of an issue for me great controller for the price and works well for me this review was collected as part of a promotion got this to have a spare  its doesnt have the exact same feel in your hand as an original controller and the toggles on the top are a little stiffer  other than that the functionality is pretty much spot on  i love the retro look to the controller  im an old school mario fan so this is definitely spot on for my taste this review was collected as part of a promotion i recieved this item as a gift in exchange for my honest review and i will definitely recommend it to any one who owns a switch i love that it is bigger to hold than the small remotes that come with the switch the mario design makes it more unique and perfect for kids and adults alike my son was so excited when he seen it in my opinion it makes gameplay on the switch easier for all players this review was collected as part of a promotion enhanced wireless controller has 100 ft range and rich bassmaximum volume output of 10wattswhich is plenty for small and medium get together it can also be used as an auxiliary speaker for phone calls and the calls are very cleari enjoyed it at my pool partyit is splash proofrain proofso perfect for beach and boat usesthe bluetooth connectivity on this device is so easy that even my 6 years old daughter can operate it this review was collected as part of a promotion wonderfully happy family fun with the excellence that we have received from enhanced wireless controller for nintendo switchwhite the attractive design gives enhanced control that we discovered gives new adventure to life with this amazing controller highly recommend to give nintendo switch the ultimate experience over and above this review was collected as part of a promotion i picked this because of the retro mario design it made me really excited when it got delivered earlier today and used it as soon as i could i am so glad i bought this it is important to note that this is powered by 2 aa batteries and i would have preferred a recharchable controller but then again it is not a big deal i love how the buttons feel so much easy to control the programmable buttons are cool to have and will have to explore more on that later overall it gave me an awesome gaming experience something to make it easier to control with these big hands this review was collected as part of a promotion i love the wireless feature of the control i have two that are wired and they easily get tangled up and prone to be tripped on by dogs running about where the control lacks the most is there is no way to charge the controller on a base or by cable it takes two aa batteries that come with the controler\\r\\nit sports two new buttons but i do not know if any of my games will support these the controller is easy to pair with the switch simply turn on and go its comfortable to hold and light weight but is a little noisy though not as much as the wired version of this controler coop could have been so cool but its unplayable with two people very disapointed about that aspect me and the gf were excited to get it and then we played it twice and havnt played it since love each level and the side levels that populate after you beat a level having two difficulty levels is a cool feature too my 8 yr old loves to play it and can do so without much help i’m a sucker for a 3d side scroller with an  interactive background the art is phenomenal and the small finer details are top notch it is what it is and it knows what it is and it does what it is very well fun gameit took me 1 day to finifh itshould have been bigger and a bit more hardbut it is a fun game extremely entertaining i love the easy and hard modes to play the game really fun so awesome that it has the easy mode too i admit i have used it just to get some of the items lol i love that it has so many puzzlelike things not as hard as some games but very nice i also like that the easy mode is still a little challenging to get everything but it is easy enough that my 6 year old doesn’t cry he doesn’t get all the items but he doesn’t cry this is my game but he also likes to play it i would recommend it for anyone really its a cute and fun game especially to play as a family really fun and thought out game a lot to do and find attention to detail is amazing so far music variety is the only draw back so fun the family loves to play this game and it’s even fun to watch the picture and everything is great but functionality is not all there just yet 21 slots still dont work with 3080 video card love this tv great picture great sound great apps easy to use i bought this tv about a month ago the picture is out of this world good since about th 2nd firmware update the tv does not always turn on i had worked for geek squad in the past so i know how these products work it is not user error i contacted support through chat and they say it is not a known issue if you go on about forums you can see it is a widespread problem id this would be corrected i try would be a 5 star review i am out of my return window so i certainly hope this issue is corrected gorgeous tv have had it for over a week and haven’t regretted it very heavy so carry and unpackage with two people directions to put together the stand were simple includes panels to hide wires and the panels are magnetic sound has been decent for watching netflix and playing switch games power cord was a bit of a struggle to use initially as the diagram on the tv suggests that one side is flat and the provided cord was round on both sides but it worked a friend suggested this tv to me when i needed to replace mine and the price was right i look forward to years of use with this magnificent tv got less than a month ago was simple to set up and the picturesound are great nice oled quality image and i enjoy watch the tv  the audio need more improvement and i suggest use soundbar or home theater to make it perfect the tv has a gorgeous picture but there are continuing issues of “no audio” i’ve noticed if i turn on say my xbox before i turn on the tv if i do this in reverse order the issue is gone hopefully a firmware patch is on the way had it for one week and have only one issue the tv would not turn on today and had to unplug in order to get it to respond hope this is not an issue excellent on picture quality the only issue that kept me from giving it a five star rating was the software and intuitive control not too snappy or fast enough but is workable doesn’t let other apps to be added like espn and so forth also there is an issue with hdmi port 4 i tried adding a fire stick to this port and it will not pick up the signal the stick doesn’t fit on the other three ports in the back but as far as the picture quality is right up there with the other oled television from other competitors for the black friday price i paid in comparison to the competition it cannot be beat no remorse whatsoever on that also the picture quality is excellent some calibration maybe required for those videophile fans like myself but is an excellent choice if you can live with the small glitches i mentioned oh the remote should have been upgraded the remote is not great for a television of this caliber it should had came with a better clicker in my view i bought this in the middle of november and i love the picture the oled screen looks amazing but i have had so many bugs and quirks almost every other day the tv just wont turn on  the power button on the tv wont turn it on and the remote wont turn it on when this happens i have to unplug the tv and replug it in there have also been so many bugs with it working with my xbox series x and ps5 the new hdmi 21 ports just dont currently work with the ps5 at all you literally cant get a picture from the ps5 if you use those ports they do work for the xbox but vrr doesnt work correctly the tv also just stops recognizing the xbox sometimes i have to unplug the hdmi cord and plug it back in when this happens i have had some weird color issues on the border of my screen i think this is due to thepixel shift option to help reduce burnin if i go into the settings and power cycle the tv then the picture is in the correct position and the color on the border of the screen is corrected i have to do this almost every time i use this\\r\\n\\r\\ni have watched movies and the picture quality for that is awesome just watching and streaming content is generally amazing if that is all you want to do then this will be fine but do not buy this for gaming right now just wait until next years models this review was collected as part of a promotion so my son loved his control i tried it it was so awesome wireless bluetooth what more can a kid ask for i will  definitely be purchasing another for my other children and  already recommended it the other moms be very thorough you miss a lot in the background but overall the game has been a blast quality game looks good and all kinds of different environments  the game is too easy as in the enemies pose little to no threat and there are no timers  fun platformer overall just not challenging all that much if you like yoshi youll love this game continues the innovation of wollly world and adds fun new collectible suits for yoshi to wear this game is fun my daughter and i love playing it this is a cute game for all ages seasoned gamers probably wont find it challenging but i really enjoyed it nonetheless my boyfriend and i played some of it together which was quite fun the only trouble i had with the multiplayer mode was that it was too easy to accidentally jump on and eat each other so far this game is very challenging but its mostly getting used to the unique environment the story line is as childish as the other yoshi games prior however when you consider that the whole premise is set from the perspective of a yoshi who is still technically a babychild at this time it becomes easy to understand how primitive their mind works and forgive the innocence of a basic story line the game is very easy to play but the environment makes for a challenge if you have played yoshis story for n64 or yoshis wooly world it is very similar to the side scroller you know and love but the difference is being able to reverse the levels and access items from afar by shooting eggs still a long way to go in this game myself personally so i cannot give it the ending a review but it is worth a play through in my opinion from what i have seen so far enjoy such a happy and fun game  seems short at first but with side missions to complete itll keep you playing for a while perfect for my kiddo great graphics challenging but still able to figure stuff out the world of yoshi meets arts and crafts in this nintendo switch game  it’s amazing how you can play flip side versions of levels throughout the adventure  i also like the costumes that are included which provide extra health points to yoshi  this is the next best yoshi game since yoshi’s woolly world on the wii u great game to relax for a few hours not complicated and very aesthetically pleasing beautiful picture at a phenomenal price the stand is a little different but no big deal i got the oled 55 and i love it but it depends on your needs the tv itself is gorgeous it has fantastic picture quality and supports lots of outputs and hd formats as well as smart integration but it is webos not android i don’t care because i use apple tv butif you rely on the buildin smart os of your tvwebos is well it sucks the tv has beautiful colors i am really enjoying my first experience so far with this oled tv i do not like to buy firstgeneration products because most of the time they have a lot of bugs which this tv had however the update in early december 2020 fixed some of the issues that i was encountering with my the tv the vrr is not working properly hopefully vizio will come up with a fix soon however i do not regret buying the tv at all if you can find a good deal i do recommend you go buy this vizio oled not at all what i thought it would be vizio has always performed but this is a little less than in the past excellent picture and cheapest tv to have 2 hdmi 21 inputs it is perfect from the start i however am still waiting for the vrr update as i wanna use vrr with 120hz but everything else works like a charm i bought this product to use with the new xbox series x this television looks incredible when everything is working correctly however theres a few bugs ive come across when i was using netflix once the main screen kept flashing in and out i had to shut it off to make it stop secondly i cant use my pc with freesync enabled 4k 120hz even though vizio says it can handle it using the hdmi 21 port i see through the forums im not the only person who has come across this problem if it is not resolved before january i will be returning this television a very smooth remote control experience for those of you who have had troubles with previous vizio remote controls color is spectacular not a great tv to move yourself wall mounts are also incredibly difficult if you have the wrong tilting versions the power cord is not the right power cord but it works it can take it two rounds or round in a square power cord havent used hdmi 21 120 hz yet so youll get nothing out of me for it great for watching movies and apps very pleased with the quality of this tv wish there was a app for vrv and funimation fair amount of hdmi for my many gaming consoles and vrstreaming computer found this at a good sale price beating out hasbro pulse  other o line s alpers thank you gs descent product  great shipping glad gs get her in the kids love it don’t really have a review but they definitely have been playing with it awesome fun  beautiful graphics  easy for the kids hard for completionists  well balanced game  great music too great graphics fun storyline and lots of ways to get extra stars and fun side missions i have never played a yoshi game but i really like this platformer and it’s so cute very cute game love the attention to detail the story is adorable as you would expect with a yoshi game coop gaming is also great though sometimes you can end up throwing an egg at your partner dont want a huge challenge just wanna have some light fun its been a busy day and you want to unwind and chill this game is perfect for you this game is very easy all the way through unless you want to 100 the thing but other than that you are gathering the infinity dream gems so you can snap baby bowser out exietence you are platforming around crafted world which is all so charming and fun to wonder in each world and something i didnt realize is that after you get the first gem you start to pave your own path to gather the other 4 gems which makes the exploration system of the game very fun again this game is pretty easy but its still just  a wonderful time that you wont be smiling all the way through extremely cute and the interaction with the world is amazing fun game with a quick learning curve the stages get harder and harder lots of fun i mostly play this one with my 4 year old he loves it glad they have poochie in it too ridiculously cute impossibly blends easy controls and gameplay with a rewarding satisfying and most importantly fun experience yoshis crafted world is everything i had hoped for  a solid yoshi title that i can choose to play casually when i want some mellow fun or play obsessively to go for 100\\n\\nthe gameplay is not revolutionary but i dont think it needs to be it is clear that the developers crafted pun unintended each level with care the rewards are in the details of the levels as opposed to the sprawling layouts of the original snes game\\n\\nsometimes it can feel tedious to play the same levels over and over again to complete every quest so i remind myself to move on we’ve had the tv up and running for two days so far it’s been an amazing addition to our homekit connected home i bought this tv a little less than a month ago got my ps5 to do the 4k 120hz but unfortunately i have been having some issues with it not working i am currently running 4k with 60hz which is still nice but i intentionally bought the product hoping for the 120hz hopefully they will do an update on it soon other than that it’s a great tv i definitely recommend it for the picture quality and amazing colors the black is just amazing 1 month in and im constantly blown away by how good this tv looks  it also was a big improvement in gaming from my 2016 vizio p series had this for a couple weeks now and i am loving it as of now i’m just using the set with my cable box and a 4k firestick and i have to say the picture is fantastic i know there are a lot of complaints about hdmi 21 and vrr supporting 4k 120hz but if you are just watching tv and movies i highly recommend this set i’m sure all the other issues will be fixed in a firmware update then i’ll give the 5 stars this set deserves i think it is the best deal of the year great picture and smart cast works very well the app selection doesn’t have xfinity stream i wish there were easier setup for parental controls bought this about a month ago and it looks great sleek design good quality picture and the smart cast apps are very convenient i’m glad i put off upgrading my tv until vizio came out with an oled the image quality is superb the onboard apps are light years ahead of the smarttv platform that plagued my last tv  the onboard speakers are good but it’s best when paired with a sound bar hands down best tv in its price range just bought the vizio oled about a week ago and already thoroughly impressed seeing as im transitioning from a tv about a 4th of the size the scale of the screen is incredible even more amazing however is the clarity of the image and the brilliance of the colors it displays watching nature documentaries will never be the same the only hiccup was that in set up the power cord is round on each end but the slot it plugs into on the tv and the picture at the site is square on one side and round on the other seems like kind of an oversight for such a high tech piece of electronics otherwise all good so far so far so good a few minor bugs in the picture settings but other then that no power issues sound issues etc once vizio deliveries on their continued support of this product it will surely be one of the best tvs of the year my daughter squished it less than a minute and it popped unfortunately we bought one with a rip in it sticky stuff comes of it it still has its shape but my son cant play with it so it just sits there it glows though the first one i purchased for my child started leaking foam before we left the parking lot and made a mess on my leather seats  so i returned it and exchanged it for a more expensive version but this larger and more expensive version also started seeping out the next day  because i didnt know what  this substances consisted of i made my child leave it out side on the patio by the next morning it had all leaked out i have it to return when i am near the store again very fun game should appeal to newer players and fans of the previous titles in the series it’s a good yoshi game yoshi controls like a yoshi you can throw eggs and jump and ground pound nothing is missing and the levels are yoshi levels its very entertaining  and gorgeous to look at its not a hard or challenging game but its definitely fun to play and collect the costumes nintendo has done it again with yoshi great job and great looking game fun for the entire family it’s a must have game yoshi’s story all over again with the added challenge of beautifully stimulating the gamer instinct to 100 i am driving myself crazy only on world 3 because i just want to perfect every level this game is a faithful installment to the franchise a true masterpiece of nintendos labor of love towards the games they create honestly i thought the demo of this game was a bit of a letdown the demo was a sluggishly paced level of pure thoughtless ease regardless of the fact that it looked and was mechanically sound being the nintendo fan that i am i picked it up regardless to try it for myself and i can easily say to date on the switch it is in my top 3 favorite 1st party nintendo games on switch the visuals and gameplay are superb with a gradual level of scaling difficulty in regards to the collection and minigame\\u200b aspect while feeling relaxing at the same time do yourself a favor and dont miss out on this absolute must own game really like the game play of this game and it graphics is so cool the feel of this game is good and motion is good too gave this game to my niece she 9 years old and love this game this game lacks the creativity and imagination as it’s predecessor the coop mode adds features that inhibit game play the “costumes” feel gimmicky and discourage players from wanting to rerun worlds to collect missed items for a game i was very excited for it was the biggest let down of 2019 so far easier than wooly world but very charming and interesting i saw it advertised on nickelodeon kids choice awards and it looked like so much fun and it is i also am very impressed with the graphics its like playing a mario game only yoshi is the main character i give it 5⭐️ stars bought this tv 3 weeks ago with the elevate sound bar best tv purchase i have ever made  always been a samsung guy but that has changed probably the best  sharpest  colorful picture i have seen would definitely recommend this set up love this tv best picture quality i have seen smart tv apps work smooth and fast gaming on my new ps5 is incredible to say the least really brings out the best regardless of what you enjoy from movies to apps to gaming we purchased this tv a few weeks ago to replace an older samsung we are very happy with the quality of the tv vizio is definitely stepping up their game however a large issue we had is the power cable is not made correctly for the tv we kind of have to wiggle it in but it needs to be lshaped we were also extremely worried having to lay it down when installing the base it is very thin and sleek but it is deceptively heavy two of us were able to set it up and did not have any damage they have stickers on where to not hold and to hold that do help a small issue with the tv is that it goes dark after a very short period of time we figure we can adjust this however it is annoying that the chromecast cannot turn on the tv the show may start playing but you have to find the remote to turn the tv on if it was off overall we are happy with our purchase and think the technology in the tv is better than what a lot of the content you watch is recorded in we expect to have many years out of the tv and think the shows will catch up to its technology pictures quality is top notch this tv has all the features you need especially for gamers \\r\\n\\r\\nonly a few things are bringing this tv down in rating\\r\\n\\r\\none being the bugs like vrr not working when 4k 120 is enabled on game consoles \\r\\n\\r\\nthe os freezes from time to time \\r\\n\\r\\nalso picture settings are grayed out when playing game consoles initial quality is awesome the blacks truly make the picture look clearer than even the 8k televisions i compared i’ve had great luck with visio in the past and hope this new one lasts just as long \\r\\n\\r\\nthe apps need some customization options it’s frustrating to scroll through unused apps this tv has an amazing picture and some nice features i believe that the firmware has some bugs sometimes the picture goes black when content is playing this is normal behavior when static content is being displayed to prevent burn in  the power mode changes to “eco” on its own randomly this is annoying because the tv won’t respond to homekit power on requests in eco mode i have also seen times when “eco” mode is off but homekit still will not turn the tv on i have many homekit devices and this tv is the only device that isn’t reliable hopefully they can get the bug worked out soon as it stands i can not recommend this tv until bugs are resolved this is a shame because the picture quality is really nice just bought this product a week ago and it is amazing the color pops i get regular updates more features and compatibility than any other manufacturer colors are more realistic than the lg cx not too saturated and it’s just a beautiful tv to look at for a fraction of the price if this tv lasts i’ll be a lifetime vizio customer at first when setting up the tv and hooking up my ps5 things were not looking 4k at all at first the hdmi slots were giving a grainy picture that did nothing on screen so i had to unplug the tv and start again even at times switching between sources would put the tv in a hiccup and would not respond to any commandsunplug and start again\\r\\n\\r\\naudio was a problem too as when turning on the tv the audio for my cable source wouldnt even be acknowledged had to switch to ps5 then back a couple of times before it would work if notunplug and start again\\r\\n\\r\\nit became annoying having to unplug the tv if i had a problem which made me rethink my purchase  but i have a friend who also bought the same model and advised me to keep my eyes open on redditcom for any work arounds sure enough some other users had to  workarounds for the tv and boom this thing is looking gorgeous ps5 runs smoothly the audio has no problems \\r\\n\\r\\nim still hopefully for an update from vizio sooner rather than later for more fixes but for now im happy with my purchase it has a great picture but i game a lot  the ps5 has problems with hdmi 21 get no pic it has issues with the vrr and 4k 120fps with the series x this is my first oled television and couldn’t be happier with the picture quality only issue is that the usb ports do not support fast charging on the station tried charging my phone and it was going to take 6 hours they exclusively sell these at gamestop only which makes them more valuable coming from themseries 2017 the whole right side panel of led went out it was time for and upgrade i was tossing between the oled and the pqx i was able to get a killer deal for either and the firmware update made me gravitate to the oled long story short this tv is amazing for a movie watcher that will utilize the hdr to it advantage being able to have all the hdr formats this tv looks amazing in dolby vision hdr10 etc vrr still seems to be an issue and any word on the oled series getting freesync premium is my only hope i hope this gets resolved because i love this tv a lot and would hate to have to return it because the firmware wasn’t up to date for my new console or a computer i upgraded from a notsmart 2013 samsung midrange with a fire stick to this in the same size 55 my wife says this oled is brighter than that tv and i think shes right i was worried about oled brightness after watching reviews on youtube but clearly the screen is bright just not as bright as more modern leds which are in reality blindingly bright after seeing those at the store i prefer this over the sunlamps that are modern leds \\r\\n\\r\\nwe watch hulu prime netflix and have our plex server the smart system was able to completely replace our fire stick as all of those apps are included in the system \\r\\n\\r\\noled blacks are simply amazing seeing the star wars logo hovering there in perfect blackness is just amazing to witness i practically bought this tv just to see that\\r\\n\\r\\nhowever the fire stick itself highlighted my only gripe the connector area is not that well designed its hides beautifully and the cable management is a delight but you cant easily fit a fire stick to this tv it wont directly fit into any hdmi ports because either the stick is too large to fit in the area or the plastic of the tv prevents it from going down all the way my fire stick has the ethernet adapter so in order to plug it into to the tv you have to use the fire sticks 3 inch hdmi cable and you cant close the cable management panels ever its moot for me because ive got a very clean install now but still that area could be bigger and more accessible the tv is leaps and bounds greater than my ancient led tv from a decade ago and not sure if it’s because i’m not playing hd content but the colors were a tad underwhelming yet still very pleasing it wasn’t knock your socks off but a definite take your socks off with some wind taken from your breathe the tv has good color and matches very well to others that cost much more there are some software issues that need to be worked out but hopefully this will be worked out in future updates i have a vizio sound bar as well and have connection issues also have had to call vizio for help to fix the issues for now i have had to unplug my tv a couple of times to get it to come on i have another oled tv and have not had these issues and hopefully these issues will be fixed in future updates i am very satisfied with this tv i was debating on getting a qled and am so happy i spent a little extra on this oled which was significantly cheaper than competitor models\\r\\n\\r\\ni replaced my 10 year old plasma with this vizio oled and was fearful that while i was buying top technology there were specs i would miss from the plasma tech they dont make anymore i was wrong everything looks better video games movies even non4k tv not only is this a fantastic tv but it successfully upgrades my family room from the plasma \\r\\n\\r\\nwatching 4k movies from a 4k bluray player is simply amazing its a cinematic experience  i have a playstation 4 that while only regular hd looks significantly better on this oled  bright and crisp beyond what i thought it would be able to do\\r\\n\\r\\nthree small nonperfect items that hopefully an update fixes\\r\\n1  the apps available are limited to streaming subscription services its missing hbo  hbo max as well as almost all live tv apps mlb fox now etc i had to buy a roku stick for the back of this tv to compensate\\r\\n2  the input shuffle lasts for a split second if you have inputs cablesound receiver roku video game etc the input screen only stays up for a few seconds so if you need to time to read you are out of luck i have to toggle selections just to keep the menu option open so i can then read where i am and select what i need\\r\\n3  the remote has some nice buttons specifically for a few streaming apps netflix vudu etc however one of these button is redbox  what  something i have never used nor will ever use it would be amazing if you could customize the shortcut buttons and then swap out which ones you place\\r\\n\\r\\noverall this is a fantastic tv i cant simply say enough how terrific the quality is setup was quick and i have no issues with the tv pros price was awesome for an oled  picture was pristine  movies look fantastic  audio passthrough works perfectly passing pcm dolby digital dolby digital plus all my amp supports automatically switching on the fly  tv looks great love center stands smartcast works great apps are stable speed is good\\r\\nconssoftware  this is beta software by any definition  the luminance setting allows you to change it but switching inputs it shows the number you set but the actual luminance reverts to the tvs default  other settings fail to remember where they are supposed to be   i am not a gamer but vrr does not work  4k120hz actually drops every other frame so you end up with 4k60  input lag is high for tv advertised as a gamer monitor  most all the cons should be fixed in firmware updates but for now consider this a beta unit \\r\\ni would recommend this as a tv but with all the bugs not as a computer or console monitor no buyers remorse what so ever this is my first oled tv so i can’t compare my experience with other brands but this vizio 55” oled tv has exceeded my expectations this tv is very well packaged and is very easy to set up the out of the box picture is outstanding but was also easily tuned to our bright sunroom the 4k picture in this same room at night is truly amazing                   i was concerned my older yamaha sound bar would not pair but this tv recognized it as soon as the optical cord was plugged in the well engineered stand supplied with this tv doubles as a sound bar shelf when the tv is wall mounted and makes for a very clean installation i have purchased six other vizio products over ten plus years i still have them all and all have been trouble free  and still working there is no reason for me not to expect the same reliability from this unit great upgrade didnt disappoint love love love love love i just bought this tv as my first smart tv my last tv was 12 years old so this is a really huge improvement i would definitely recommend got a new tv had less then 50 hours on it and it already went out it is an amazing game with great unique japanese styled art and culture with great controls and an amazing plot love the graphic so unique gameplay is one of a kind as well the only thing i have trouble with is the voice acting maybe they should discard those voices all together as it gets a little annoying with time if you like zelda esc games with a little bit of dmc gameplay you’ll love this game played the game on the ps2 and the graphics look so much better on the ps4 played this game back on ps2 havent even broke the surface of this remake yet but absolutely loving it it is a fantastic game with a seemingly never ending journey the art style is aesthetically pleasing each character has own quirk that makes them unique i played it digitally through ps3 loved the graphics and living art work of a game solid story where any and everything you do effects the ending with multiple endings action of combat could be improved a bit but otherwise change nothing if you want a fun study game for all ages with historical and accurate mythological ties to japanese culture history and religions in a way that gives representation of early eras of japan look no futher if you love wolves you’ll love this game the storyline is intriguing and well thought out i’ve been actively playing this game for a while now on the switch it’s such an adorable game and is 100 one of my favorites the storyline and the style of the game never get old especially for how low the price of this game is now it’s worth every penny and more and i 1110 recommend buying this game for anyone i was a fan of okami on the wii i would play it for hours this brings back alot of good memories with updated graphics to a degree i mean it wouldnt be okami without the brush stroke painting style graphics\\n\\ni have recommend this to a few friends and will recommend it to others as well awesome xbox controller  exceeded my expectations  love the green grips and the transparent front shell  makes me proud to be an xbox fan for 20 years now truth be told i havent even taken this out of the box  but its an anniversary edition and should be a collectible so i think ill leave it tucked away for a while  i will however say that i love the dpad redesign and the new capture button which allows you to take screenshots without slogging through the menus great controller textured grips was ok me case and 20th logo awesome addition to the collection since i have one xbox from every generation 20th anniversary seemed just right completely awesome controller for devoted xbox fans i bought the original xbox the week it came out and never looked back i wound up with four 360s my original white 20gb model redringed twice but i also have the mw2 mw3 and reach consoles graduated to an original xb1 after the 360 got an xb1x for the 4k and now have the xbsx this controller embodies the whole life span of the xbox i love the 20th anniversary logo and translucent look the black surrounding the green x on the guide button lights up bright white and looks great i got two carbon black controllers with my series x so i traded in one for this controller my favorite part of the controller is the rubberized grips i already liked the textured grips on the newest controllers but the combination of rubber and texture really keeps this controller in your hand i always use regular batteries in my controllers but razer makes a matching controller charging stand that includes a battery pack and cover and it looks as good as this controller so i am considering purchasing that as well amazing controller absolutely beautiful design and feel i love the textures on the back is so much better than the regular ones a great addition to my small collection love the design of this controller and glad that microsoft came out with it for their 20th anniversary for xbox awesome controller gotta love the old school color scheme the new xbox controllers are refined to near perfection this translucent design is just what was waiting for beautiful controller what an excellent way to celebrate 20 years of xbox im a big fan of story of seasons and mineral town was one of my favourites so im not disappointed here would absolutely recommend it to anyone who likes the series and wants an updated throwback to the older versions of the series now i really hope they bring more of them onto ps4 though i have really enjoyes this game i had played before on switch but now i have trophies once marvelous departed from natsume they were able to return us to mineral town with this release originally on switch as a choice between male or female take over your grandfathers old farm and make a name for yourself befriending the villagers and growing crops your own way and enjoy new quality of life features while missing some old ones great game reminds me more of the harvest moon n64 days great artwork take this with a grain of salt as ive never played the original version but its a perfectly serviceable sos game pretty fun addicting even but doesnt go out of its way to be anything spectacular the character portraits are great but the 3d models are sub par the gameplay is fun and gives you plenty to do and unlock but the fatigue animations have no right being that long and often and seems it was only put in there to pad out the game andor annoy you there are also issues of you getting stuck in your horse after you dismount and getting blocked by villagers you have to wiggle to get unstuck which couldve been avoided if they made the hitboxes a little smaller as much as i criticize i still get a lot of enjoyment out of it i love taking care of my animals and wooing the bachelorsbachelorettes the dialogue is cute and funny too if you like the sos or the hm series i believe you will enjoy it its just a shame that its pretty bare bones bought this for the hdmi 21 features with vrr  to play with my next gen console tv picture is fantastic but it needs firmware update asap to fix glitchy hand sync issues with hdmi inputs and to activate the variable refresh rate features 120 \\r\\nvizio needs to tweek the motion tearing algorithm not too noticeable but it does show up unlike the lg cx way too easy and the extra boss is way too hard and strait up boring 3 day with the tv  so far everything has been great  only problem so far was the tv locked up after signing in to youtube tv and i had to reboot the tv if you love yoshi games you’ll love crafted world just received this vizio qled 65 tv yesterday set up was remarkably easy thought it might be too big for our living room but its perfect  great clarity sound and colors  highly recommend great game and good for lovers of yoshis island and yoshis story only problem i’ve had is gaming with 120 hertz n vrr and also my tv doesn’t turn on if i leave it off for long enough graphics are amazing but this fame won’t hold your attention for long i’ve owned a couple of vizio televisions and knew the quality would be excellent the oled tv takes this to a whole new level i’m glad that i waited a few months after seeing the amazing oled screens from other brands i was lucky to even get it when it came out everything was sold out i’ve been playing the game for about a week or two i can honestly say it was the best purchase worth every penny i bought this a couple weeks ago and i love it i love the picture really fun game beautifully made with lots of little deatails that make it fun it is a good product with excellent picture quality awesome game my 6 year old son loves to play this all the time very easy game for him to understand and also challenges him to find the secret flowers always love a good yoshi game boy oh boy is this tv good very happy for the price i paid its the best tv on the market it’s 55 inch but feels larger because the bezels are so small easy set up process i wish it ran on google tv os by its no biggie deep blacks crisp visuals great lighting not too bright not too dim runs great on apple tv xbox and netflix great upgrade over my 5 yr old m series that still works great love it so far a little disappointed the theme song isn’t the same as yoshi story i can recommend this tv because if you just “plug and play” you will be happy with the picture i bought the oled 55 to pair with the elevate in search of atmos  dolby vision what i found was very close to what i was looking for \\r\\n\\r\\nwhat i’ve come to understand is that the technological requirements for implementing features like hdrvision  atmos514 are complex and if you’re a little geeky like me you’ll probably appreciate the granularity made possible by said complexity alternatively you may be frustrated by it i was not deterred but admittedly i was unprepared for what this device could do for example i had to update my hdmi cables simple but also come to terms with the dynamics involved with the features i was seeking complex the diversity of the audio visual ecosystem is real but you probably already knew that i think vizio is handling it well \\r\\n\\r\\nso far i only have 2 minor criticisms \\r\\n\\r\\none  all the great features for me at least require near constant use of the app i’ve used the app on iphone 7 plus ipados and the new iphone 12 pro max the app could use more refinement it’s kindasorta slow on all devices and you have to scroll the adjustments kindasorta slowly to get them to register properly \\r\\n\\r\\nthe ios app also presents different user interfaces depending on what device i’m using it on which you’d expect but it’s not what you think on ipad i see the same interface as the 7 plus so i’ve kept my old iphone around because the remote interface on that device offers up way more features on the 12 those features are several taps away hidden behind menus for some reason \\r\\n\\r\\ntwo  i purchased the elevate first and from the moment i powered up i was experiencing static from the height speakers so i updated my hdmi cables and followed all troubleshooting online the static persisted then i added this oled tv thinking that my old tv was the obvious weak point the static has persisted i hope that i do not have an actual hardware problem as i’ve successfully played dolby va content directly from the tvs own apps even then i heard static so i will need to chat with support at some point instant classic feels like classic snes yoshi must buy for switch owners this tv was a present and i could not have picked a better one myself i love the realness the colors are so true this game is amazing its got great graphics and amazing landscapes the creativity and level design is phenomenal its easy for those that just want to beat the game and challenging to those that want to 100 it overall its yet another home run from nintendo thank you awesome game with novel game mechanics stylish graphics and interesting story line beautiful and fun but you spend a lot of time trying to figure where to go next just as great as when played on the playstation 2 it’s a great game that i played as a kid and being able to revisit it in hd was amazing it’s still an aesthetically pleasing game that will hopefully make it into tour top 10 i loved this game it has an engaging story line the art was so unique and enjoyable the side missions were very cohesive with the main quests the only odd part was the ending but they made it work all in all i highly suggest playing this game ❤️ game play is fun but i couldnt get past the voices of the npcs its really bad i was only able to play maybe 2 hours and i had to return it because of the voice sounds a classic pa2 title remastered for the ps4 okamihd is a timeless masterpiece suitable for gamers of any age an excellent classic rendered in hd the only drawback is the janky camera control beautiful representation of japanese folklore through ukiyoe like cellshading \\r\\nits just for everyone who appreciates welldone games\\r\\nand very fun as well just wow i love this game one of the greats i feel if you had it on ps2 and loved it there is no reason to not own this gorgeous thank you microsoft and xbox for 20 glorious years what can i say its a good looking  controller that ill probably never use but just keep it on display great feel and precision the grips make a huge difference would recommend this controller is a huge upgrade in feel over the standard carbon black controller it just feels more quality the plastic is smooth and pleasing to touch it looks amazing and the green grips on the back are rubberized so it is more comfortable to hold feels good in my hands buttons are responsive and not clicky looks awesome great weight and feel love the ability to switch out sticks to gain the best game play beautiful controller and very well done the see through is subtle which i really like top quality for your average controller really nice design it will last if you take care of it big xbox fan this is one of the coolest controllers o have held pretty awesome when you look at the box with a blacklight you see the original duke controller shadowed in while this is more or less a standard xbox sx controller it does have a grippy underside making it more comfortable and now to the real reason for this purchase the cool factor the 20th anniversary controller has a seethrough front plate and green on black guide button and yes the green grippy underside is not only comfortable but sets the whole package apart from others if youre looking for another controller  tired of the same ol same ols then i recommend the 20th anniversary edition its quite nice i got this tv for a really good price and it’s picture is great i just bought the tv and after reading some reviews i was hesitant but decided to make the purchase and right now everything seems great i also got it at a great price compared to the other oled tvs so far i am enjoying our new vizio but i am a little disappointed with its consistency  its only been 2 weeks and ive had to unplugrestart it due to no response to the remote twice and green flicker during playback twice  4 times in 2 weeks would prompt a quick return from others but im going to stick with it provided no other issues arise  lack of the ability to download apps not included is a bit of a drawback however i really do enjoy its picture quality having a true black is very nice when watching tv in a dark room or with game play ps4 picture quality is excellent but still waiting for their software to catch up with the hardware they provided such as 21 hdmi inputs great technology features and connectivity hdmi 21 and earc etc for my sonos arc vivid picture and value for money i bought this tv about a week before the ps5 came out and i thought it was just gonna be a regular ole oled but man let me tell you this is the best tv i’ve ever owned once the hdmi 21 bug is patched i have no doubt this will be the best oled on the market 1010 we replaced an older vizio with a newer bigger vizio oled the picture is spectacular my husband especially enjoys football it looks like you’re there they have picture presets that make it easy to get just the picture you like setup is a breeze and we are older a great buy for us the picture quality is similar or maybe better than the c7 i already own great value for money and you have all tech to future proof \\r\\nthe only problem i have is the visio software hangs a lot like 3 times a day and you need to unplug your tv from power socket to fix it i am hopping a sw update can fix it i use apple tv to overcome this we purchased our new tv about a week ago and the sound bar and love them both i love the vizio products only reason this doesn’t have 5 stars is due to a possible short in the power cord and no assistance from the purchase place yoshi games are always charming however it’s safe to say we’re all still yearning for the charm that was yoshi’s island \\r\\n\\r\\nthe graphics in cw are superb it amazes me how realistic and detailed every single thing is in this game the levels are fun but there’s not much challenge it’s very easy to complete a level without taking any damage\\r\\n\\r\\nas with most yoshi games you still seek out the flowers coins etc in every level but now there’s a hide and seek challenge with each world where you’re tasked to find hidden items in each level it becomes real redundant and exhausting so much to doseecollect perfect for all sorts of minds young and old new to yoshi or returning fans having played through most of the game i can say without a doubt that i have no regrets buying this game i dont believe that ive ever played a game with this much creativity poured into it as the title suggests the levels are expertly designed to resemble the crafts that youd make as a kid with the distinct yoshi charm if you enjoy lighthearted games with diverse levels or love the yoshi series then you cant go wrong purchasing this game                                                                                                 pros diverse level design adorable aesthetics entertaining for all ages plenty of collectibles responsive controls for yoshi                                                                                                                              cons wonky controls in a few side levels occasionally too easy repetitive music downgrade from woolly worlds soundtrack i loved okami when it first come out on the ps2 this is plays exactly the same but with brighter colors and faster load times still completely in love with this japanese mythology tale stunning visual  artwork storyline is great as well there is no voice actorsjust loud weird sounds as character voices which is probably its only downfall i played this game back on the ps2 when it came out originally a decent 40 for this game back then its a great title in my opinion it will always have a place in my heart  and on my shelf i truly recommend it as a lighthearted and fun loving arpg title try it i do not really appreciate all the talking because it sounds extremely weird but besides that everything is good the plot is great and the art is wonderful i had always wanted to play this game since k was a kid\\r\\nthe story and characters are incredibly charming and the animation style is wonderful this game is essentially a classical japanese painting come to life the art is amazing and the combat and exploration are great while the brushwork takes some getting used to after the first hour or so it becomes second nature i bought this game a a few dqys ago and it is just absolutely beautiful and fun totally worth the time it takes to beat i have owned this game for playstation 2 and loved it so much oh i needed to get the hd remastered version of it the storyline is easy to follow yet still deep the hackandslash gameplay is fun and the game length is just perfect id highly recommend this i wanted to play okami from the time it was released but it wasnt available for playstation now that it is i am playing almost every day and enjoying the heck out of it the only complaint i have is the camera is a bit tricky to work with but im not an avid game player so maybe for someone who plays more often its not as big a deal still deserves five stars owned it when it first came out originally and now have the ps4 version game never gets old the 1 thing you have to do is have a app for comcast xfinity  so you dont have to rent box they only have samsung and lg apps hdmi 21 not working as of now but picture is insane i purchased this oled on a early black deal and had to jump on it now i’m a believer of do your own homework on any purchase you make glad i made this decision every that comes over says wow i can’t believe how beautiful the picture looks now playing my xbox series x on it it’s the smoothest lag free jitter free television i’ve ever had i don’t worry about burn the tv has safety features to prevent so i’m becoming a vizio fan no complaints at all so far bought about a week ago colors and blacks are way more impressive than lcd had a really bad issue with the soap opera effect especially on satellite but after about 4 days of adjusting the settings i got about 95 of it cleared up seems the issue comes and goes now depending on how the programming was recorded i bought this just over 2 weeks ago because i had been wanting to dive into oled but not at oled prices i am so glad i took the chance on this great priced model the setup is a snap the features are amazing and the color man the color is out of this world it makes every show like a new show every game more real and the hdr10 just ups that to a new level  if youre looking for a great oled tv at a great price this is the one the picture is incredible vivid colors amazing blacks only disappointment is with cec my denon receiver won’t turn off when i turn off the tv which wasn’t a problem with my previous vizio lcd tv hoping for an update it is a great experience to sit and watch a movie cable network sports etc with this tv this television is a night and day upgrade from my lg led tv the pure blacks and contrast are stunning waiting on calibration but up to now it is fantastic i love the picture but i bought it to use with the xbox series x coming soon and as a pc monitor  it looks great on my old xbox one x and uses the hdr and vrr available there wonderfully  however as a pc monitor it becomes annoying quickly as it will dim or go completely dark frequently throughout the day  buried in the user guide it says the tv will dim after 1 minute if it detects no change in the picture and will go dark after 10 minutes and there is no way to override that  it is difficult to read a page of a document in less than a minute especially when so much is visible on the large screen  i was able to fix the dimming by using a slideshow as my desktop background that refreshes every minute but it only works if some of the desktop is always visible  also sometimes it goes dark even while i am typing on a window on the tv when it never dimmed first requiring a remote click  this only happens when using my pc not my xbox or with the built in apps  hopefully a future firmware update will fix this tv to be a better pc monitor my son loves them and says…” works super good” lol he’s so happy great purchase very comfortable love the base and quality sound my boyfriend loves this headset he broke his old one and decided to try these and they are a good quality headset sounds great took a star cause it’s on the heavy side and doesn’t have a ton of padding on the top of your head gives me a headache if i wear it for long periods it’s a pretty solid headset for the price  very excited to no longer have a cable to my controller great headset clear hearding great for first person shooters sound quality is awesome the mic monitoring doesn’t pick up much background noise unless it’s shouting or something particularly loud outside the volume dials for the game volume as well as party chat are a plus i love the mute buttons being built into the dial and the fact that there is one for game volume and one for chat volume it’s good just wish the surround sound was a little better its been so long since i played a console game that i forgot how fun it is thats when i decided to pick up this game on my day off and just have fun its a really fun game and i like the idea of using japanese legends for a story tho to get what  you need for a quest you sometimes have to skip it and continue before backtracking and finishing also omg you can feed your fellow animals and they have a cute little cutscene w♡ after wearing for a while my head starts to hurt lol … they are comfortable but sometimes i’ll get down on a game for 68 hours  after about 3 hours i’ll start to really feel the headset  maybe add a bit of more padding i don’t know… i do like the head set though good game it has a very strong sense of art and japanese folk culture it felt nice and was comfortable but whenever i played any major games it staics and glitches out i was so excited to find this copy of okami it was such a joy to play on the wii im glad i can play it on the newer consoles it was fun replaying it over again thats why i bought it enjoyable game and graphics looks beautiful as always on the ps4 this is a title that was originally released during the last year of the ps2 and honestly one of that consoles best it features a beautiful artstyle innovative interface and great story steeped deep in japanese lore with an overall theme of restoring the beauty of nature with some humor thrown in from time to time as well with an epic zelda like gameplay unfortunately this would be the swan song for clover studios famous for viewtiful joe but they certainly went out on a high note some minor graphical glitches mar this version but otherwise a truly great title and one of my alltime favorites from its era i played this way back on the ps3 or 2\\r\\nso long ago\\r\\nloved it\\r\\nwanted to replay on my ps4 i’ve been playing for a bit and the only thing i noticed was the camera takes a bit of getting used to once you get used to it the game handles pretty well i am pleased with the work they did remastering one of my favorite playstaton 2 games now i have both and im happy its a fun and adventurous game that has an old school feel to it its different in that paint brushes work right in front of you its worthwhile for any collection the few negatives are slow frame rate and unadjustable difficulty level but its fun and worth checking out great controller it when feels different than the normal one the soft plastic feels so much nicer in the hands than the normal textured plastic definitely recommend would have been perfect but  top right bumper came clicky and had to return   sold out everywhere so   kinda sux beyond my expectationsbeautyfunctionality precision just awesome i purchased this controller as a secondary back up so far its been as expected great quality and i love the translucent faceplate fast shipping and save time good grips solid buttons love the green that lights up on the x great controller just wish the grip was all around finally another controller from microsoft worth investing in  nice metalic sounds when button inputting nice green grip on back of controller  nice dpad was blown away with the design such as the see trough top and the rubber grips on bottom instead of classic satisfied with this tv i got this tv for multiple usage mainly next gen gaming needless to say the picture quality on this tv is top of the line one of the best deep perfect blacks contrast ratio is superb as well i was very impressed with how good this tv actually was i love the 6 customizable picture setting as well dolby vision looks great on this tv as well but i do have some gripes with this tv one of my favorite apps is not on this tv shudder as a huge horror fan i was pretty bummed also some minor audio issues as well although the tv has a super premium look super thin \\r\\nfuturistic feel i feel on edge when anyone even gets too close to it i’m even a lil scared to adjust it myself in fears of potentially damaging something for so e od reason the tv o my works at 1080 120 hz at the moment i do a lot of gaming and that’s a major let down atm i’m hearing this is being fixed in a further update this tv is is a heavy hitter forsure at a great price highly recommend 4k computer gaming with no perceived lag or tearing love it great picture and sound looks great in living room very nice stand easy assembly excellent i’m very happy bjkmbmmammsmsmznzmznnznznzn i bought these tv a month ago and i so very happy i did beautiful picture i can’t wait to buy my xbox series x to see how great it plays games i tried a qled and returned it for this zivio oled\\r\\nbest move ever no comparison bought a month ago and am pretty pleased with it needs some firmware updates sent for some dancing pixels and white line at the top of the black bars when watching some content also every once in a while when backing out of an app the screen flashes green i turn off the tv and then right back on and all the sudden its fixed happens about 3 times a week not the device or hdmi cables trouble shot those already  stand is horrible btw ended up wall mounting it for safety purposes again hopefully some firmware is coming down real soon bought the service plan from the store i bought it from as a precaution i purchased this a month ago  so far the tv has shut itself off while i was watching it i lost volume on the tv twice no  the mute button was not on yesterday it would not turn on the light was on in the lower left hand corner but no picture until i unplugged the tv and then plugged it back in  i called tech support all they could offer was that if this happens again i should call them when any issues arises  they were trying to be helpful absolutely gorgeous picture easy setup the best tv i have ever owned im pretty happy about this tv picture quality has exceeded my expectations the level of detail is phenomenal better than high end big brand oleds thanks to vizios processor there are still some issues that needs to be iron out like pixel jumping which happens here and there its like the content on the screen jumps back and forth real little jumps but noticeable thankfully vizio has fixed the issues i was having with the tv when i first fired it up this tv is ridiculously bright and im telling you without these little hiccups this would be the best oled currently on the market bar none the gameplay is simply amazing i bought it at random and it was definitely worth it okami was met with critical acclaim on its release for ps2 and lauded as one of the most beautiful games on that system the years have not diminished the impressive celshaded artwork modeled after ancient japan okami does not skimp on gameplay either with legend of zelda like dungeons towns and combat okami is still a delight to play and anyone with a ps4 and a love for gaming should consider this title this is a very beautiful hd remake port of the original ps2 game i highly recommend it and it’s affordable i bought it for my girlfriends sister for helping me a lot great game and nice that they rereleased it for newer consoles  love the art style and the game play still holds up well since the first release  not sure how it would compare to the wii version with wiimote support but if you enjoyed it on ps2 youll enjoy it here  didnt really make much use of the touchpad support for celestial brush techniques but that could be something some players may enjoy more than the usual analog stick this game is published by capcom and produced by clover studio now defunct but a great hidden gem  please buy this game is you like the legend of zelda games  yes there are a lot of tricky parts in the game including fishing  the games intro is about one half hour long so it may bore some instant satisfaction players but please enjoy this artful game for a game that came out originally on the days of the ps3 it holds up well as a game the controls are not the worst and the story is done well my only issue was the voice acting made it hard for me to focus on the story at times i bought it for ps3 but i still wanted to leave a review great game with an awesome storyline this game was a gift for someone else but they were so pleased to receive it they loved the original and had asked specifically for this item i bought this game as a gift for a family member  and she loves it we used to play okami on playstation 2 so we were ecstatic  to discover the title was available for ps4 as well  the game its displays beautiful art with vibrant colors and the many different techniques available as well as a vast world to explore make this game exemplary i got this for christmas this year looking forward to the much needed sequel whenever they get around to make it replay is very high to newcomers of this classic play station title i remember the first time i bought it i was still in school and the gameplay and story was so addicting that i may have stayed up in the late hours despite school in the morning i bought this on chance then and i have never regretted the purchase i love the headset sometimes it disconnects while in use or people can’t hear me but a simple power off fixes it and again it’s not often usually happens when i walk out of range then come back to the game it kept disconnecting from the xbox all the time there just bad and a waste of money i got the steel series x9 and they are awesome the headphones are a comfortable fit sound quality is very adequate there does seem to be a small connection issue from time to time overall a purchase worth making it’s really good for the one like to play gamesit feels amazing this is the biggest waste of money ever headset lost connection multiple times first day wont stay connected more than 10 minutes wont let me update firmware total crap headset will be returning tomorrow extremely happy with my purchase headset feels very high quality and sturdy sound quality is great no issues with interference or connection looks really cool a nice item to have to celebrate 20 years of xbox looks cool works just fine worth it for retail price but nothing special worth paying scalper prices for great product to celebrate the 20th anniversary try using a blue light on the box absolutely gorgeous controller a nice throwback to xbox’s beginnings i bought this a month ago and it is awesome tv is great gaming is great to this visio compares very well with lg but also includes smartcast easy and lots of tweaking settings i dont use the speakers so i cant say how well they are the tv is so new that they dont have a manual for it yet  but the settings have pretty clear hints when you are ready to try them  it has a beautiful picture with a wide field of view there are 4 hdmi inputs with 3 on the back and one on the side im very pleased with my purchase best vizio ever and i have 4 vizio tvs picture is great gaming experience is great just as advertised  colorful and fun item for cookie monster fans also collectable the graphics are pretty goodgame is a little hardbut the batman costume is really ltand the skills are good i bought this last week because i had the third one and needed the first two i was not disappointed when i bought them however i have the policy about the scratches and the first one arkham asylum is scratched and at a certain point it stops working so yea but nonetheless still great games i bought this bundle not knowing that it came with all of he dlc and to my surprise it came with it they arr two of the best games of the last generation and they both won game of the year in their years respectivly camera is nice but doesn’t work with vr since the ps5 doesn’t recognize it as a ps camera if you want to stream with it the camera will be on your monitor as well blocking gameplay this is a nice quality product it does everything it says it is my only issue and the reason why i returned it is i thought it was for the ps vr you do not need this and it does not work for the ps vr the ps5 camera is amazing and so easy to use i think anyone that streams off ps5 should have one bought this for a buddy since he was twitch streaming w just a mic he loves it as do i bc i get to see his pretty lil face now ohhh an btw this literally shipped in a day he was goin in vaca for the weekend and it showed up a half hour before he left seriously excellent timing gamestop good quality and picks up position of player without moving the camera key feature its great my only complaint would be is that there is no mic for the camera other then that the visual quality of the camera is pretty great i love it the thing is not compatible with ps4 games that need a camera sony is the best quality picture from a name you can trust this thing works great and matches perfectly with the ps5 this is my third used joycon from gamestop the first 2 came with my console and we’re worn so badly they were both unuseable i bought this as a replacement and it does not charge on the console clearly gamestop will take used joycons without even testing them and people realize that and are taking advantage do not buy i have gotten two new joysticks from yall and they both work great so far the used controller has already stopped working it is not recognized by the switch and will not charge this product worked perfectly very glad i purchased it product functions well packaging was intact process of receiving item was simple its a good product but be careful because the sticks can get drift so far we havent had any drifting issues which is saying alot with a left nintendo joycon all in all were pleased with our purchase i seem to go through these joycons annually so i figured why not try a preowned one and for the most part its worked really well  every once in a while it needs to be recalibrated about every other week or so but no complaints so far it broke already 2 months after buying it and it doesnt work controller appeared new and fine when purchased after a few weeks of my son using it i noticed a growing frustration i assumed it was because he is 5 and was upset about losing in his games it wasn’t until later that i noticed a major defect in the controller it controls and makes the characters in my son’s game walk and move when he’s not touching it as if a button is being pushed or stuck you can hear the clicking sound too as if someone is pushing buttons while it’s untouched my daughter had me put it together i had fun she loves it kids are so happy to have the ps5 and its accessories  gamestop customer service has been outstanding and we cannot be happier not bad at alljust add lighting  its a winner the shipping and delivery was perfect arrived earlier than expected and works well has helped make my stream feel more personal and professional wish that it was able to zoom more but that is a minor gripe and not the fault of gamestop it does what it states although it would have been nice if they had thought ahead and added additional features and components to it a mic would have been great ability to incorporate it into your vr setup would have also been a great addition\\r\\nmaybe they have already considered these type of additions and could be planning to add them in to a new version to go with their next psvr headset if so hopefully they can make their next headset wireless the size and style of it are well thought out so that it doesnt take up a lot of space as well as matches the design and color scheme of the ps5 \\r\\neither way this is worth buying if you are mainly interested in streaming while using a headset with mic or just a stand alone mic great starter camera for streaming great 1080p quality very good i plugged it into the ps5 and nothing happens i can not get ut to work it doesnt work trying too get invoice too take it back my son loves the camera he uses it to stream while playing on his ps 5 i have not used it yet as i am waiting to purchase my ps5 it has a good build quality and looks awesome i purchasedordered a new joy con but received a refurbished one my son immediately started using it and it’s been working fine so i didn’t feel like returning it but paying for extra for the new and getting used is frustrating joy cons are very sensitive had to get a replacement gamestop delivered it fast at a reasonable price i have had to replace the left joy con 3x in the past year it keeps drifting looks like new but came with drifting problem that joy con is known for used unit already had sever drift  had to take it back i looked everywhere for a single left joycon for my boyfriend who dropped his switch and broke just the left one i finally found this after months of looking and it was perfectly you would never know he broke the original it still moving to the left the same problem that i had with the controller before  how can i fix this  please let me know it was broken when it showed up beware buying used joy cons delivered timely like brand new great 1 year warranty very satisfied work just like it should have and fast shipping on time the ps4 camera was better honestly the took the mic off of the camera which was super useful other than that its alright i guess the mechanism that holds the camera up can be adjusted easily as a stand picture quality is just “ok” but it gets the job done make sure you have enough lighting ro give the image quality the best chance i wanted this camera so i could continue streaming like i did with my ps4 the camera itself is great quality is lovely the features are cool if you have a set up with a green screen however the ps5 streaming ui is horrible i much preferred ps4s so ive opted for getting a capture card to stream via pc\\r\\n\\r\\nthis camera cannot be used on a pc despite being a usb camera so now its literally useless to me sad because i really do love it the camera is cool and looks great although it shows a slight difference from the ps3  ps4 cameras but it goes well looks wise with the ps5 the clarity is very good although not much use for the camera just yet dont buy you cant even use it to talk in while chatting with friends  i havent even been able to use it once  save your money or use the old one if it even works  have no clue perfect for streaming on ps5 just make sure your room is well lit so it can look sharp easy to use hook was super easy couldnt be happier with my hd camera it’s small and compact and gets the job done i don’t like having to go through so many menus to adjust it though looks good but unfortunately only for recording not compatible with psvr so not much if use to me and returned worked just fine no drifting or issues to be had its practically new honestly it didn’t work it’s a tough item to keep operational advice buy new with a warranty experiencing drifting this is the 3rd controller i’ve replaced with gamestop the joystick on every left controller we’ve bought sticks and will move on the screen without touching it this one was no exception it charges it works correctly sometimes it’s just annoying to have to keep reporting it it came quickly and works great  my son says it’s the best controller he had now everything worked well we are happy with the purchase and the price as soon and it arrived i connected to my switch and the joystick is drifting started drifting in less than a month get the warranty you will need it got this joycon  it had drift issues  exchanged it  still had drift issues  sent it to nintendo for repair  they fixed it  still waiting for gamestop to refund my shipping costs for the exchange  not holding my breath has joycon drift i recalibrated several times and joystick drifts south no matter what i do took 3 12 weeks to get to me and then when it finally came it wasnt usable do not recommend getting this product used at all from what ive played its a epic game i cant wait to play more ive actually played this game before but its been so long id kind of forgotten about that but nonetheless its always fun to go back and play again the story is great action packed what couldnt you like about the game except wheres the follow up i freaking love theif when i played the demo it was really good now since ive got the game its even better the gameplay is awsome the graphics on it are amazing because i love unreak engine and the feeling of sneaking around and being surprised is fun i love this game the graphics are great the challenges are awesome i can’t get enough of this game for my son  i dont get it but he likes the adventure love it for my taste this game could’ve been better but it’s still ok just started the game but so far it seems pretty cool i like stealthy games and so far it’s exactly what i like good game play good graphics since this game is 4 yrs old still holds up in my opinion i really enjoy this game but it took some time to get used to being in first person there’s no way to switch it with this game i love mario games and excited that luigi got is own game it’s a challenging game however it’s still extremely fun to play i absolutely love the luigis mansion games and the 3rd edition is no exception fun intense game easy too follow also challenging the entire story campaign is good and a bit easy with different solutions on where someone should take a specific path it’s quite interesting on how a specific character takes a path and the actions creating that scenario it’s a fun game to play i definitely enjoy playing it storyline and side tasks are cool lots of collectible items to gather melee attacks takedowns kinda slow once i learned the movements this is fun to immerse oneself in the idea seemed like such a great one but this title is absolute trash repetitive game play with slightly better than linear game maps take everything great from dishonored and just throw it in the garbage what youre left with is this game promptly returned it kudos to gs i bought this game about a month  ago and i have played very little of it but the little bit of it that i have played was very enjoyable i bought this product because i needed a new game to play was hoping it was going to be good this game was boring drawn out the game play was slow and sluggish the graphics or ok at best do not buy this game the makers of this game should have to pay to have gamers play it i bought this game a few months ago and it was alright there were some things i didnt expect there to be like a lot of nudity sooo yeah i bought the right when it came out ive probably put a good maybe 10 hours into it as  said in the title the game its as bad as everyone thinks it mainly depends who you are and what type of gamer you are if you are some who enjoys playing stealthy type games then this game is great for you if you are some who doesnt enjoy that type of stuff then this game will be total trash to you i for one who enjoys stealth type gamescharacters and i loved playing this the graphics arent that bad the story is kinda short and kinda confusing would recommend paying real close attention the game play is good the only thing i hate about this game is the ending now im not going to spoil anything because i dont want someone to read this when they were planning to buy the game best luck with this color as far as joystick durability is concerned we got this one as a replacement works perfectly and we like the color only downside was covid caused the shipping to be delayed  i new it was going to be a little beat up because it was pre owned but the unit i received was just disgusting and filthy i bought the joycon back in may it came after a week or so and the buttons did not work they were stuck and unusable no big deal sent it back and got a replacement \\r\\n\\r\\nwell the replacement comes in the mail the buttons work but the joystick suffers from drifting\\r\\n\\r\\ni am very disappointed gamestop did not check the functionality of these controllers and thought it was ok to ship them out as is i bought this like two or three days ago found out it was cracked it’s an expensive controller you don’t really have the option to get it cheaper everything seemed fine at first but after only 3 or 4 uses i started getting really bad joycon drift contacted gamestop and never heard back it was in good shape physically but it had the drifting problem and the buttons didnt work sometimes horrible controller was beyond dirty l button did not work  drift issues nintendo is known for drifting joy cons but with the warranty from gamestop i’m now covered the game is fun but would be better with online vs mode this game is not fight night and if that is what your looking for this game is not for you the game is fun for a little trash talk between friends ive unlocked almost every character so ill be trading it end soon i would have rated it zero stars if i could i purposely bought this because i needed a new left joycon because my previous one stopped working and of couse as soon as i got home as started using it is was malfunctioning way worse than my old one it was a waste of my money and time and gamestop should not be allowed to take any used controller without knowing if it works or not because theyre basically just selling non working controllers at this point  down on the joystick didn’t work i returned it for an exchange was told it couldn’t be tested prior to me buying the 2nd got it home to find the sl button didn’t work going to return later this week and seek a full refund and look elsewhere does not last long this is my third joycom in a year it’s move by themself i play and the view move always up ☹️ it works perfectly with no drift but the controller has been opened by either the previous owner or gamestop and i can see the corner of the ribbon cable sticking out its not pinched in a way that effects functionality but it has been opened and therefore the warenty with nintendo is voided joycon was in good condition no damage or issues it took 2 returns to het one that worked properly but i had no issues with returns i purchased this because the original i bought was defective  gamestop would not honor the original sale price  i dont plan to return to gamestop joystick drift gamestop does not test there comtrollers his old one messed up so we brought a preowned one i was little skeptical but it works great dont buy this game it is so boring bad graphics and really bad inventions of the game all of my friends hate this game one of the worse games of my entire life thief is a game for hardcore stealth gamers you can not pick this game up and run around fighting everyone head on you have to stay in the shadows and be patient in thief you cant be that invincinble hero like most other games who take down whole armies if you try you will most likely fail many times this is a game you have to dedicate time to to learn how to play and to learn to learn the maps this is not for the average gamer when i first got this game i thought it was going to be easy i was wrong this game really makes you think the graphics are awesome the game itself is very fun as you progress through challenging levels the sound is great but i cant stand the sound of garret when you attack but you have the option to turn off garrets voice i wonder why its a very fun game but you need to get good at it so overall its a great game and i recommend it to most gamers thief for new gen is amazing the graphics are breath taking london is beautiful game play is great you feel like a thief  most dull game ive ever played does nothing to get you interested in the story or game play returned it within the first few hours do not buy this game fun to play through twice or maybe three times but overall i think it is a really good game i really enjoyed the storyline as well as the gameplay and all the different ways you can complete missions i didnt have extremely high hopes for this game but it still disappointed me in some ways i thought this game was going to be more of an open world in which i could steal almost anything but this was not the case a lot of the items that you are able to steal are similar so it gets repetitive and i lost interest in it over time the storyline is forgettable as well as the side characters it all feels pretty generic the control scheme is a bit tricky too and it took a little while to get used to it the game includes things like lock picking wirecutting and things of that nature but it just doesnt have the lasting appeal after having finished the game there were side missions that i could complete for some extra coin provided by garretts friend basso but i wasnt interested in doing the tedious jobs this game has potential but it turns out to be pretty boring and bland in the end save your money dont buy this game new or used this is my first thief game i have played and i had fun playing it really the only problem i have with it is that the map is kind of hard to understand its hard to get around for me i got this game on the day it came out and i still play it today it has replay value i saw the trailer for this and it totally hyped me up i played the pc game back in the day and loved it this however was a flat out disappointment to me the graphics are last gen and not new gen the controls were horrible and the gameplay was sub par the world was boring flat and hard to navigate missions were not special either i understand it is called thief and youre suppose to lurk in the shadows but could it have been any darker couldnt see obstacles doorways pathways or pretty much anything the combat was clunky and lack luster as well i played through the first few levels and then shut it off and traded it out for watch dogs at least i got my moneys worth from that game\\n\\npass this one up i thought it would be a lot better but its not that fun you cant roam around a city you have limits all you can do is play missions and steal stuff its the same stuff over and over story was horrible gameplay wasnt nearly as good as dishonored graphics were substandard and sound eh nothing good in this game thief i was hyped but not the crazy hyped but my expectations were flawed the combat is dreadful i mean you only get like a black jack right the bow is fun use the city is absolutely trash i could never evolve with it the side missions are outstandingly poor i mean maybe a few caught my eye for a few moments other wise the story is a little bland after you caught the eye of jewelry the graphics are what got to me i actuall could sit and look and thievery was another fun participation in the game otherwise i dont have much good to say about this game i liked certain moments and if youre a die core thief fan get this i think due to the lack of game release on the xbox one most people like myself were so anxious for a new game to play we rushed rite out and bought thief what a huge mistake poor graphics poor maps poor gameplay really frustrating i felt like i was again playing a game from the early 90s and a horrible one at that the name of the game is the best part of this game because it speaks the truth this game is a thief stealing your money from your pocket first i would like to say that i am a fan of different stylesgenres of games and i have been playing games since the late 70s so games have been part of my entire life i dont want people to think i am just bashing a game as a first time gameplayer the previews of this game looked amazing but once you play it all you do is sneak in shadows and loot cabinets literally thats all you do you will also get an uncontrolable avatar that jumps from sneak point to sneak point it is very annoying especially when you are trying to go undetected it is also not a free roaming game as most of us define free roaming i could deal with the no free roaming bad sound track and poor story if you did a bit more than just loot people houses this game is perfect for you if you want to be told where to go and like to just loot items from cabinets for the life of the gameplay i was expecting more but i got bored very fast i didnt like how short the focus feature lasted which left me spending hours looking for secret buttons and things to interact with so i could either find my way out of a place or continue the game it would probably be good for kids that have a lot of time to spend on mundane things i realize the game is about stealth but my character edward cant defend himself or punch his way out of a paper bag its pathetic it would also be nice if the field of vision was better especially when on ledges or close quarters but he usually cant look all the way up or down which is silly i never finished the game because i found it pointless and sold it because i have no desire to go back and try it again the controls are glitchy at best try sneaking up on someone when the control glitches and jerks you into them oh look you could climb that wall right nope unless there is a dangling fence on the wall you cant climb it coming from other parkour type movement games this one fails horribly it was so bad i returned it the next day thief is one of my most favorite games out the game playgraphicssound is excellent you have to be very alert in the game watch out for people you will like it as a fan of the earlier thief games i was very happy that someone has decided to continue on with the ip but all in all i was less than impressed its like they took the antiquated gameplay from over a decade ago and just updated the graphics the mechanics and overall feel of the game are as if the developers had never even heard of games like assassins creed splinter cell hitman or dishonored the world isnt very open paths to take are quite linear and loading screens before each new area completely destroy any effort they made to be immersive i found the audio to be frequently quite aggravating as guards tend to mindlessly repeat the same handful of phrases and the volume doesnt seem to vary well with distance  so even if a guard is on the other side of the room hes just as loud as if he were standing right next to you shadows are not always well defined and object interaction is limited and repetitive so you get no real sense of depth i really think they could have done so much better with this game but its still worth a play through if only for nostalgias sake the reason i think this game is great is because of how you can basically chose your own rules of engagement if its killing all the enemies or moving though the level with out anyone knowing also this game has a nice feel of a jump and scare game this game is ok i play it when im bored of other games it is not that great it should be 30 max brand new if you like stealth and searching for the same things over again youll love it  im gonna finish it as fast as i can so i can sell it on ebay  dishonored makes this game look and feel silly  i’d like to be able to review the game but gamestop sold me an unreadable disc unlike various other games that i got that would just freeze after getting to certain points where data was unreadable also very annoying this game wouldn’t even recognize as a game just disc unreadable very disappointed this game might be worth getting if your a simpsons fan the graphics are pretty good and look like the tv series however it is not a game i would recommend unless your a simpsons fan the dameplay is not the best there are much better games out there based on gameplay but simpsons fans should enjoy it i bought this as a gift for my sister so not sure what she thinks but she wanted it because we used to have it and it got lost or something bought the game and it works just fine but there is no sound the gameplay for the simpsons game was average it took place in springfield and the cyber world in my opinion there was not enough springfield you were mostly in a cyber world the whole game there was a good chunk of the game that happened in different video game worlds that just made the story poor other then that the game was awesome it was fun and if your a huge simpsons fan like me you would enjoy it a lot also the game never gets old weather you play it now or in 10 years it will never get old it is a average game but not enough springfield this game is alright i am a new fan of the show i tried the game and it was pretty hard the controls were very awkward in my mind this is not the best game this game is awesome it is so fun and crazy which games are not like any more there is so many people that want games like assassin creed and fps and im sick of it i love how silly this game is yet creative and its fun also it has split screen co op which is the best when friends are over or if you have siblings it is short but it is repetitive great buy good but not the best there are others games this can be a kids game but its fun to play  i like the game had co op and i like some of the features you had but it can get complicated if you do not look up what you are suppose to do i like that the game had the perfect visuals it was almost like you are one of the simpsons i dont like that the game can be more like a puzzle then i am used to all in all it was not a bad little game its really cool but short its the kind of game you rent but still cool i was looking forward to playing this on the xbox one while waiting for titanfall to be released the game is nothing special i mean its not terrible but its not great i would recommend that you play dishonored because thief is pretty much the same thing just a lamer more confusing version there are so many glitches in this game its insane ai glitch on walls while listening to a dialogue you will often hear dialogue from a previous room youve already listened to playing over the new dialogue controls are terrible combat is clunky areas that look open and accessible are often not complete waste of time and money ive been playing theif for the last week now and ive been very well pleased with the game the game play is good the unique ways you can find different loot is great the only thing i was really hoping for was nextgen level graphics but unfortunately that wasnt the case but all in all a great game to play this game is very boring the story is not bad but spending your time to beat this game is painful this games trailer really got me excited to play it but once i actually got the game i found out it is not anywhere as fun as it seemed it was going to be the game has really nice graphics but the game play mechanics are very poor anytime you actually get into to combat it is horrible because you can barely control how your person fights the story is very boring with horrible voice acting this game also feels a lot like a poor version of assassins creed and dishonored i give this game a 4 because it looks nice but its gets boring very quickly first off the ones giving bad reviews dont like stealth games for me i was one of those gamers only liked run and gun games until i played thief the story kept my attention the graphics were good not ps4 good but still pretty good the game has intense moments you dont want to get caught it has a very scary mission be ready for jump scares and try playing it late at night lol anyway stop reading reviews watch some youtube videos and then go buy this game this is one of the best stealth games i have ever played graphics are great and controls are smooth and easy to pick up get this game if you love stealth play although the story is confusing i have to say that this is one good game if you like to do a lot of sneaking then you may like this game the controls i didnt like at first but got used to it the controls feel like a fp version of assassins creed only the controls this game is built around sneaking not combat so its not a game where you can take all enemies head on it takes skill and thinking to play it and is one of my favorite titles pros side missions sneak and steal element easy to learn controls cons confusing story extremely difficult on hard an almost impossible achievement and controls as it felt weird not having a jump button but easy to get into im an old time fan of the original and this game brings back all those great memories of thief from the past thief is a stealth game and all the reviews pointing out flaws dont seem to realize this isnt a fps love stealth youll love thief poor graphics for xbox one boring gameplay i recommend do not buy this game save money instead because plenty of good games are coming  ive played this game a lot of this game and the truth of this game is that it has good graphics if youre with a friend can spend the game in cooperative fully recommend this game because you play while you have so much fun i recommend this game to fans of the simpsons too product was not working properly had to buy new controllers bought for my  husband to replace the one that he broke it was a replacement with the warrantee no hassle the joystick moves up at certain times ive already calibrated it didnt charge didnt lock into the handheld console slid right off needed to exchange it i was glad that they give me credit for the broken controller  that helped me to save some money  this is the third or fourth controller we have brought for this game make sure to get the extended warranty in case something goes wrong it will save you a lot  if you’ve joycon gets broken or like happened to me your joycon does not work properly when you use it the first time at home i was very glad i bought the warranty and was able to go back the next day and replace the browne joycon for a working one we bought a preowned controller because my kid wanted one the same color as the one that broke blue  very happy with the purchase it works great like new and i feel a little bit better about one less electronic in a landfill   paid the additional 499 for the extended coverage and it still came out cheaper than buying a new only comes in gray single one  the sales associate was great and the whole experience was a nice reminder of how much i enjoy game stop has super bad drift returned it for another same problem it didn’t work i had to take it back and get another one but i will add gamestop was amazing about it joy con drifted employee stated item was tested and had no issues great working controller and a cool color to boot i bought this preowned and so far i am very pleased my last controller was constantly moving to the right and it continued to get worse so i decided to get one that was preowned love this color too very true to what the picture shows my switch is finally getting the use it deserves my old old pro con had drift and never locked on to the console and it was bought and replaced new this one was preowned and works better than my previous ones great price my left joycon broke and this replacement was priced well and works great i bought this used joycon at a local gamestop it started drifting immediately after connecting apparently the stores do not test them they just sell them  broken  to unsuspecting gamers the used joycon i bought from this store has a stick drift problem unlike anything i have ever experienced super unprofessional it’s a awesome accessory to have and manageable to use with the exciting games too i bought the joycon to take apart and reshell all the pieces worked like a charm worked perfectly and the sales person was very caring in assisting me   i played this game for about an hour or so their are some ups and downs the things that i really enjoyed was how they incorporated the use of shadows so i thought that was very cool the game play can be a bit stiff but it can get very intense at times as well it feels the creators of this game did not put much effort into this game the sounds are ok and im not really feeling any emotion of the characters and the running and the jumping is only one button i like to control everything on a character especially a first person game the guards all look the same the fighting is quite lame it literally makes you to just use your bow and the knock out is simply a hit to the head every single time it gets very boring and repetitive but it makes you want to keep playing because the story is actually quite interesting as a huge fan of the original thief game i am sorely disappointed by this sequel terribad x10 the most boring pointless game i have ever played i cannot even bring myself to play it for the achievements it is that bad\\n\\nstay away when i read some of the reviews before buying thief i was a bit skeptical but i have to say i like playing it a lot its a fun game to play and waste some time on there are some things that are a bit disappointing but overall a good game most things about it are bad i definitely recommend to go watch the full ign review of this game because everything in that video is what ill be saying its just easier trust me watch it i honestly fell in love with this game as soon as i started playing it thief is one of the best games i have ever played because i have also loved stealthy parts in video games and when i play online against other people in first person shooters i was always the stealthytactical player the storyline and gameplay for this game is just superb graphics are amazing and so it the sound quality just love the stealthy aspect about the game going around hiding in the shadows using my blackjack shooting my bow and most importantly stealing haha a game like thief is so rare now these days a game that requires strategy patience maturity intelligence and most importantly stealth skills people need to stop hating on this game just because its not your typical call of duty or battlefield this game is so underrated and deserves a lot more positive attention i was really excited for this game before it came out but quickly realized it wasnt what i expected and i got bored fast all the game is about is being sneaky and trying to avoid combat let me tell you this gets old quick im on chapter 5 and i cant sit down and play this game for hours on in because its the same thing almost always sneak and steal sneak and knock a guy out rinse and repeat the dialogue isnt that great either one good thing i can say about this game is the environment looks pretty cool and some of the music during some scenarios are fitting the game isnt terrible but its far from great its good for 1 play through but nothing more i give it a 710 thief by square enixedios montreal is once again doing it right this game has a lasting appeal i knew i would want to try thief since i played tomb raider by the same people i love the graphics sound of the city and the massive map you can go anywhere on the map and play the objectives as you see best you have three options on every objective to either be a ghost opportunist or a predator with completing the objective you are rewarded if you meet the assignments according to what option you have choose the game tracks your actions to how you react with the surrounding environment thus it determines which option ghost opportunist or predator you have chosen to become the sounds of the city are as real as you could imagine there are so many ways to play this game and so many decisions to make as you make your way through the city trying to steal everything you can it is in first person i normally do not like that but i do enjoy it with this game thief is absolutely a game to add to the xbox one vault in your home i had high hopes when eidos montreal said they were making this game i had high hopes this is the company that did deus ex human evolution which was a beautiful game there are some minor problems with this which i can deal with but when you add them up it starts to feel like they just didnt care about the franchise that they were making 1 the voice acting in the cutscenes was average but when half of the times the lips and the voice move off key and it looks like a english dubbed chinese movie 2 the characters in the story are so boring they have no appeal to the story and they are very forgetful 3 the load point between parts of the city were stupid crawling in between boxes and lifting a log at the end was to generic they could of changed up the animation to different parts ps also ive only ever had motion sickness once in gears of war franchise when you run and this game was making me sick i had to play in 1 hour runs did this happen to anyone else i would recommend maybe a rent but dont buy this and you wont be disappointed this game is boring and it flat out sucks not what i expected at alll dont buy this game at all the storyline in this game is really intriguing the gameplay and combat is incredibly fluid the only problem ive had is that some of the cutscenes have been kind of skippy and the graphics are acceptable but not fantastic unlike some other stealth games ahem assassins creed it is not impossible to use stealth successfully not necessarily all the time but as a useful strategy in certain spots i was excited for this reboot and it has certainly not been a disappointment well worth the money this game lives up to its promises and provides entertaining coop with endless replayability very nice works well although everything from game stop always woks well it’s stop working i’m going to switch it out again works perfect connected right away no issues what so ever bought this since my previous joy con started drifting no complaints here controller is already pulling to the left only had it a few weeks  the worst part is the first one we got was broken right from the beginning  would never recommend buying this product used drift was gone but the b button stuck ended up returning and just buying a new pair the staff was extremely pleasant and informative not just with the product but with warranties as well i like the neon blue joycon it replaced the black factory one it drifts a little bit to the left but other than that its pretty good things dont last my super nintendo still works after 20 years i threw that thing at the wall more times then id like to admit point being they make things like they used to by far the most comfortable and best headset you can buy for the playstation i bought these for my husbands bday and he said they are wonderful he loves how sturdy they are and the mic mute feature with the flip of the mouth piece is a great addition although the audio quality while the connection is stable is great the bluetooth connection does loose stability at times  the connection will drop and then require itself intermittently  its unfortunate since i really do like the design the noise cancelling and the audio quality had for 68 months and everything was working perfectly…until the mic started to have a major issue with static ended up have to buy a new headset because the issue became unbearable i am extremely  happy with the build quality and sound quality especially the sound is amazing i connected with optic very clear phenomenal sound quality and comfortable convenient and helpful switch to increase and decrease party chat from game sounds unlinks every other week so i have to unplug  replug the usb into the ps4 perfect for blocking outer sound enhanced for combat to hear enemy footsteps all around best headset for both gaming and movies sounds great i’m not a fan of the boom mic although the fliptomute is good  the fitment isn’t great for me personally i’m a big dude i use it for my ps5 and it works amazing wouldn’t get any other headset please do not buy this game  i wish i had bought a physical copy so i could sell it on ebay and at least get some of my money back solo boring you spend the whole time crouched down stealing the same stuff over and over again game is fun for about the first 30 min then your just waiting for something new to happen but it never does  this is the first review ive ever left on anything its usually something i do not do but i feel the need to warn everyone else i do not understand how this game got any positive reviews at all its mind boggling this is the first thief game i have ever played and i have to say its a lot of fun the only complain i have is that in does not feel realistic enough for me when your hiding in the shadows it feels as if your not really hidden because the shadows are not dark enough to hide but over all the game is fun if you want to pass the time dont buy this game…5 minutes in and you see the little potential it has it is awful not enjoyable and at times i cant believe i paid hard earned money for it okay i had to write a review i do not do this often from the first time i had watched the preview for this game i was enthralled i just had to have it i went out and reserved it i thought about garrett constantly ryse and tomb raider kept me satisfied thief was gonna be better right i mean it was gonna be epicwrongcontrolling garrett is like controlling a dog on a leash who doesnt want to go in the same direction the combat is awkward garrett is very limited in space there is a white flash that crosses your vision repeatedly i do not know why i was bored within the first mission the controls are sloppy and not user friendly this game has been the biggest epic fail in my gaming career i am 34 years old and have been playing for a long time i now have a game and guide that are useless i could go on and on in a more inappropiate manner but i will not also you continue to steal the same items over and over candle holders knifes rings mask gears magnifying glassthere is no free roaming i felt like i was in a box everything is tight and cramped i just had to write a reviewmy first review everi am still so depressed this game is okay but it does not live up to its predecessors i have the xb1 version and it looks and feels like last gen i wish i didnt waste the money very below average graphics for the xbox one controls are terrible characters have awful voice overs this is one of the worst games i have played in a long time im so dissapointed i feel like this game stole 30 from me just because gamestop gave me 29 for trade in when i got this game i was immediately in love you can steal loot and sneak to your hearts content its amazing screw call of duty this is my baby i wanted this to be a great game and it simply fell short of all expectations the stealth mechanics are excellent some of the best i have experienced the graphics and overall game play however are not very good at all this feels like a pc game not an xbox one console game climbing and jumping down are horrible you can never really tell when you are able to jump down off of a ledge and often you simply cant stealing things is often an exercise in patience as you slowly open a cabinet slowly pick up a goblet and slowly close the door again try doing that before the guard returns and more often than not you dont voices are often disembodied or worse come from the wrong direction i finished the first two chapters without even discovering where to purchase or craft arrows that i need to stealth properly this is the kind of game that you either like or dont if you do then more power to you if you dont then faults abound looks like i will add this to the shelf of rainy day games when i am bored out of my skull yet another disappointing release i like it i wish there were more to it though more to the missions and story mode it is a fun game if your in to a rpg and a shooter at the same time easy shooting for those who like that kind of game and cant play them  multiplayer is badreal bad but gameplay itself is interesting and fun good gameplay experience i was able to play it with niece it had really nice combat too great game for sword art online fans and shooter type games this game incorporates both of those in a great way that is fun awsome game wish all the talking was in english tho enjoy the gameplay some cutscenes are a little too long great game good controls story is kinda a one run thing and pvp is pretty decent game is really fun but a bit of the quests can be confusing and the combat system but overall it’s a good game the controller that came with the orginal switch stopped working so i needed another needed replacement they had a preowned for a tiny bit less than new i hate joycons this is one half of the fifth set i have purchased im over 1000 hours on the switch thats about 200 hours per joycon yet my xbox controller is over 1000 hours on its own got it used for a great price with my pro membership with what i got from the pro membership benefits and what i got when i traded in two nonworking controllers that needed to be refurbished was this controller essentially costing me 3 and some change i bought it used for my son  it had to be charged before syncing it to the system but besides that it works and it was in good condition unfortunately it seems the item was not properly tested before being put out to be sold it can slide off without holding the back button but it usually doesn’t happen while i’m playing on it it still had the same problem as the original one that came with the unit still has drift glad i got this for my bride to be since hers was being weird works perfectly fine only problem is it registers as a pink left on my switch and it drives me crazy small problem though for a great deal so much fun and awsome graphics and funny character designment this is by far one of the best games i have ever played minor spoilers \\r\\ni have completed the game and i have many issues about it one is that the game boasts about choice but 99 of it doesnt differ from pressing x to continue the choices you have have the same outcome or response but the description makes a big boast about how your decisions matter the illusion of choice but extremely obvious it doesnt matter \\r\\n\\r\\nfor example you get something like what should we do boss \\r\\n\\r\\n lets save her mom\\r\\n we came here to meet her mom \\r\\n\\r\\nplot holes everywhere this game should be avoided at all cost if you believe common sense should exist the game forgets its own mechanics when major events occur why would one try to attempt sacrifice so save someone at low hp when the skills extreme healing shots self healing invulnerable block and free dodging skill exists brilliant \\r\\n\\r\\nsome fights or adventures are cut short even if youre doing extremely well also youll be shown with a single pistol and weak so youll fit their plot line \\r\\n\\r\\nyou become a leader but have zero leader choices makes absolutely no impact to the game even though they make a big commotion about it \\r\\n\\r\\nthe conversations and emotions are comparable to jr high level everyone must be hormonal in order to think and act like they do here all of which your single dialog choice appears as two has no impact and is barely better than one what you hear from the main cast \\r\\n\\r\\nai is horrific and can throw sticky grenades knives ect through walls with perfect accuracy be ready for an extremely unfair fights so i hope youre ready to cheese some conflicts \\r\\n\\r\\ndodging mechanic can make dark souls experts cry when you crouch your movement is either extremely slow or a forced stop of the trigger is pulled you cannot move while firing crouched well when you roll you are forced into a crouch at the end you can try to roll again with the same result or jump out of it this dodge doesnt work well on many attacks \\r\\n\\r\\ndialog and development choices are very poor \\r\\n810 cut scenes when they try to redo a boss fight \\r\\nconfusing weapon modification and dungeon warp system \\r\\n have a single discussion between party members on quests that repeats every 5 minutes\\r\\nenemy players have rediculous accuracy and damage \\r\\n unable to change weapons skills level up or purchase bullets on quests you must return to do any of this due to this of you equip a new type weapon and go on a mission you will likely have to restart when you find you have zero ammo and no notification of this \\r\\nplayers jumping and grappling are extremely clunky \\r\\nif you wish to do any meaningful side content you must restart the game to get to it \\r\\nstory is more about your partner kirito  friends and your partner i recognize i said that twice but thats how much it focuses on you have a throw away character with essentially no meaningful impact on the game \\r\\nall throwable tools are hard to aim with fixed distance and cant aim up or down \\r\\n\\r\\npros\\r\\ni loved the character creator \\r\\n\\r\\ngame is more forgiving with deaths compared to previous sao games you keep all youve collected including exp and credits \\r\\n\\r\\nsubquest and bounties speed up process as they can be redone and are flexible \\r\\n\\r\\nfalling off a cliff removes very little hp and teleports you back however this would happen less if the grabble and jump wernt horrible\\r\\n\\r\\noriginal voices and subtitles however theres no english audio so theres no choice\\r\\n\\r\\ncustomizable controls \\r\\n\\r\\nloot system is nice \\r\\n\\r\\ncustomizable partner is amazing\\r\\n\\r\\ncombat isnt bad sometimes skills are fun spent almost 2 hours of tutorials and cut scenes just to find out i basically one shot everything love this game series i think this is one of the best out of all the titles they have we watch the anime and love it got the 1st game it was good but not what we were looking for this one is better and love the game play so far 3rd person rpg shooter you are not kirito but you have the option to play as him and other main series characters eventually  good game so far its a rpg style game so expect a lot of grinding but in general is a fun game to play despite the heavy criticism the game is a fun spin of the actual anime series whit a new in deepth story and lovable characters all in all the game is really good and fun to play i also love the anime its hard to sum up my feelings about this game since i have so much to say but overall i highly recommend this game if you like animejrpgs anything like that you will have a great time as long as your stick through the intro the intro is very spoon fed which was off putting for me since i usually play jrpgs and the like so it felt very basic and the tutorialexplanations were somewhat slow to me since i already felt like i understood about the game already overall the game play is fluid i play on a ps4 pro i havent experienced any glitching lag or otherwise poor performance the game is fun theres a lot of content and a lot of innerworkings that keep it challenging as well as interesting character customizations are in depth and fun as well as how you can play with character builds skillgadget sets and modify and enhance weapons not to mention theres a ton of dlc that really adds a substantial amount of gametime overall i have been binging this game a ton ever since i picked it up about a month ago i definitely recommend this to any anime rpgjrpg fans you guys sold me a broken joy con not good at all had bought this to  replace one of the switch joycons that originally came with the console and it also became dysfunctional along with another brand new set that i bought shortly after  nintendo don’t make your stuff so pricey and not have good quality to it cant calibrate it because joystick doesnt click other than that it works fine excellent condition will for sure buy the other side if needed man behind counter was super helpful and kind being as i don’t know anything about joy cons i like it a lot well first off i would recommend that you just get new joycons they don’t fix it when they resell it to you  that being said this joycon still drags a bit but it was usable though i had to try 3 others and test them out before i left the store 3 stars for the price it is over expensive and it already shows sines of a drift problem the controller is badly made it doesn’t stay locked in place properly other than that it’s fine its used so its a little scuffed but it works and thats all i care about joy con works perfect preowned grandsons are very happy and store employee synced and updated the controller to their switch top notch bought this set as a christmas gift for my gamer fiancé and he loves this headset no complaints the sound quality is perfect and the headset itself is super comfortable highly recommended this headset is pointless with the ps4 slim version with out the optical cable i move the toggle more to game volume and it kills all the audio i move it towards more chat volume and it just enhances the sound then you have the master volume these are not compatible with the slim version awesome headset it has alot of features and its good for pc also its worth the money great deal and works great with my ps5  very comfortable headset these headphone set is far the best to what i need and more comfy and loud and clear thanks i use these headphones all the time when i am online with my friends in gta online and when im playing solo games mine might be defective i got an older version also makes a crackling noise others can hear that doesn’t go away best headset i’ve ever owned i’ve had a couple rig headsets in the past but the wireless 800hs is hands down the best headset i’ve ever used rig user for life well i would give it a 5 but i didn’t realize that when it said that i can adjust the game chat and the video game sound itself that it only meant “in game chat” and not the “party chat” witch was the main reason i bought it if i had known this before i would say the headset is only worth 80 not 150 very nice headset everything is there that i wanted and a bit more audio is great headset is more than comfortable and easily allows for hours of continuous usage there are a lot of controls for listening either game v chat and also overall volume i really like the wireless feature of it i have not had any problems with delayed sound it really allows me to be free while i game and lets me stretch or move in a situation the mic is one of my favorites it is autolockeddesigned to be a certain distance from a persons mouth but in the time when a person wants to produce the artificial gargling trash talk when the mic is up close it does bend to an extent obviously dont break it by bending it too much it is plastic but not flexible like some other mics one of the best touches of the mic is the small sound indicator as to whether or not it is on or off definitely saved me in times where i just want to rage by myself the charging cable is the same for a controller so no big deal one slight disadvantage is the requirement to make the headset wireless the box that is needed to connect device to headset uses a usb cord i play on ps4 so i have to hook it up in the back and then have my controller charging cord in the front while this is not a horrible dilemma it is mildly inconvenient at times and i thought it should be something that needed to be addressed overall good purchasea little expensive for my personal thoughts but i think that small details really make up for it and make it worth buying its a fun game if you want to enter the sao universe it is in the hack style of rpg game play buy it if you enjoy hack or are a sao fan i play it and the others with the kids and we enjoy reliving the series ill give it a solid  7510 fans of ggo will like it and has characters from all sao different series and games due to it being in japanese i cant fully enjoy full game when first heard about this game i was excited but after watching igns review on it i was turned away from it but then i saw some gameplay of it awhile ago and thought to try it for myself and after playing it i can say it is much better than the review made it sound the gameplay is fantastic and addictive and if youre a fan of the anime like myself then you should experience it for your self and not let some online reviews make your mind for you solid gameplay fun and engaging however i was annoyed by the japanese only voice overs as well as how short it was plus there were some points where it got super hard super fast and just left me enraged at the difficulty need to still get the dlc which i will at somepint one excellent game but only one flawnot in english a good action rpg its a focused fps rpg that plays really well the missions can be repetative and its not very story driven but good nonetheless if you love the anime sword art online youll love this game  its a 3rd person shooter too fun story and its for anime fans in a nut shell sword art onlinefatal bullet is a great game from the sao game series but it differs from previous games as in this one it focuses on guns and not swords as such it can be a real challenge to new players to the sao series and also contains minor to major spoilers to previous games im so happy i got this game love being able yo make my own charater and play with family and friends has a great storyline and im happy i get to play in the story with my very own charater the dlc is awesome as well i cant wait for more it was broken  no matter what i did the stick veered upward hopefully this one doesn’t get screwy like the one that can with my system do not buy they resell broken that appear to work for a week the replacement left joycon is fine and works properly was broken and had to return low qaulity not worth the money it costs breaks easily without bieng abusive good to have extra joycon in case something breaks or wears out got this for my daughter shes the one that uses it bought is used and the joystick had quite a few wear marks kinda disappointed but oh well ya it works well but i mean it’s not like a game review so it’s not up for debate it just works and that’s it i do however appreciate that they were able to send me a single joy con because i lost my other left which was sad ok that’s all thanks for reading bye everything works great the only small issue is the joycon doesn’t lock when attached to the switch console out of the 8 pairs of used joycons only needing 4 this is the 3rd bad one the controler sticks and cannot calibrate it should do more testing before reselling i love these the headphones really good sound quality mic is really good quality i just love these 10010 best hesdset i’ve ever bought you can adjust so much about them and they fit great its like a pillow on your head lightweight n comfy accurate 24 hour battery life easy to use i wish it had 3 more things 1 virtual surround sound and 2 i wish the volume would go up about 2 more notches and 3 and aux port to be able to use w my phone without having to buy a usb c otg adapter for my phone this headset is pretty good but the highest the sound can go isnt even on par with the turtle beach stealth 700s i have and they are the same price this headset is more so for those who chat with friends as well as are looking for comfortably because it is an amazing headset for the comfortable portion my son was excited  to recieve the headset it is broken i bought online and the store we usually shop at is closed  i have emailed gamestop amd have not received a reply  i paid 100 for broken headphones overall very good headphones only thing is that they don’t have super human hearing for games like cod but they are excellent at canceling out background noise very loud and clear sound and have great battery life i would recommend these headphones i have medium to long hair so it tends to slide out of place a bit with the extra strap it has for comfort great for long gaming sessions great sound quality but not the best sound for helping me pinpoint an enemy location in a live action fps like my most played game apex legends comfort make up for that tho i tend to play for hours with these on they what there supposed to do they havent shocked me yet and unlike my previous head set there enough comfort in these headphone that they dont cause any discomfort i think there good these headphone are definitely better than turtle beaches overall sound is good but bass lv not to great sound not to loud but its better than the sony headphones and turtle beach 700 lose connectivity so far sound is amazing easily adjustable and confomfortable on my ears the headphones are nice but its little features on other aftermarket headphones that i thought would be standard thats not i was used to the voice on my turtle beach 400 that told me which setting i was on and if i muted someone these just give a beep which i thought was lazy also when i power down my old headphones it would automatically switch back to my tv audio on these i have to physically pull out the cordlazy again but the headphones are nice mic good n sturdy and they only pic up my voice not every sound in my background i would give these a 3 12 or even a 4 star but those things i stated earlier i think should be standard in a headphone in 2020 i got this game when i was younger and it was a lot of fun thank you for a game that made me very happy when it comes time to name your animal ot doesnt work properly she and i tried over and over to name it looked for solutions online but she never got it to work this game is good for little girls who are interested in barbie i was 10 when i got it and i thought it would be fun and have more to do with the dogs and teaching them tricks but its mainly about barbie and her dog for little kids it would be fun but theres barely any choices to choose your own dog like i said okay for little little kids who like barbie this is the best game ever made ps this game is better than assassins creed brotherhood and halo reach combined it is wicked hardcore gamers get this game great game only reason i took 1 star away was the game could do better at explaining things sometimes other then that really good purchase kept pulling it off for purchase til showing up as a discount game and for what its worth a decent purchase i bought the game a year ago finally finished it story line was good a lot of work done on this great job it is one of the better sao games that i have played i love that it is an open world map and you can actually edit your character to a degree the game does allow you to change your character over time and to have access to different weapons without having a specific class like call of duty i feel that some of the monsters are repetitive or they change in color which is why i gave it a lower rating online play is not as great as sao lost song so if your looking for online game play i would not suggest it however if your looking for a open world shooter this would be the game the game has good mechanics and really show the improvement of the sao series with this title i bought this game this month and enjoy it but an option of language be better if youre into sao it is a must buy overall great gameplay and graphics there’s plenty of exploring and plenty of customizations tons of things to fight and shoot down i have plenty of side quests that i’ve completed in two days and there’s still plenty more as i progress through the game this is my kind of gamei only wish it had a psvr mode bought this game about 2 weeks ago for my kid he loves sao i have played previous installments in the franchise and this one is the best so far still needs a bit of improvement but good a positive thus far is the ai controlled teammates arent too bad i have seen much worse graphics are good story line is interesting character development is pretty straight forward and there is a decent amount of customization that said some big negatives is weapon selection can be a little limited types of enemies is very limited and repetitive and overall game play could use some improvements to bring in more in line with similar games in the genre\\r\\n\\r\\noverall i would recommend it if you are a fan of the games when moving down with left joy stick my character moves slowly so it doesn’t work fully my left joycon was lost a few weeks ago and i didn’t know what to do i had bought the switch with the neon colors and was disappointed to find the left neon joycon was not available for retail sale gamestop was the only place i could find it so i made the purchase it arrived quite a bit late but i think that was a fault of usps not gamestop and it was worth the wait my original joycon had issues from the start so this was actually a step up i highly recommend this as it is half the price of a new one and it functions and looks perfectly it works good plus i didn’t have to get a different color than the one i already had works perfectly as if it was new was great to be able to just buy the left joycon to replace my broken left joycon insteaf of having to buy a whole new set every left joycon i buy pulls to the left after about a week i think nintendo needs to fix the problem it work for awhile then would randomly unsync during gameplay rage inducing it is slightly broken but easy to fix\\r\\ni just want to know ahead of time thats all this was a used product that worked for like 5 minutes after getting it home and it was worn on the side this product was returned and since new ones were only a few  more went with that bad experience first time we ever bought something there that didnt work actually had to take it back its been twice as much to buy the full set a both joycons the added trip  destination to my daughter it wasnt working was very painful very disappointed with this control  not working properly amazing sound great quality product as described and packaged very well decent price and compatible to top ps4 headsets for sure good not great audio quality the toggle dial for game to chat audio controls both simultaneously and doesn’t control one or the other awesome headset holds battery really well and sounds good great headset crystal clear sound and ingame chat well worth it a bit of a complex setup but the range and sound clarity make it worth the price i bought this right when it came out it works great and i only charge it once a week good sound and 2 years later still going strong and i threw it once and didn’t break it  i get it that some might get a defective unit out the box but mine have been great sound quality is good on group chats just remember if you want chat only and no game sound you have to hook up a optical audio cable in addition to the usb to the wireless box that transmits to the wireless headset or you won’t get chat only you will get a mixture of game and chat great sound very comfortable great battery life love em best headset ive ever owned sound quality is awesome great headset for everyday use extremely comfortable with great sound quality deep rich bass and great conventional use they feel kinda cheap but sounds good comfortable and the battery life makes them worth every penny imo really cool and detailed lightsaber heavier than i expected it to be this lightsaber will make a fine addition to my collection i bought this today and it wont turn on even after changing the batteries best deal on this item and the detail and effects on this is better than any before it the weight of it and the design made my nephew a happy camper was definitely what my son was looking for  definitely a upgrade from the previous light saber he bought great product  best kylo ren lightsaber available   shipping packaging isnt very good though the detail on this is amazing and i am just so happy with this lightsaber the color is great and i had no problems with itwould highly recommend for star wars fans this review was collected as part of a promotion this lightsaber is truly a star wars fans dream this is so realistic and fun i play with it way more than the kids its so vibrantly lit and feels so good in your hand this is displayed for everyone to see this review was collected as part of a promotion best part of this lightsaber is the blades are removeable can display hilt only which is how i have it has flash on clash great sound effects more accurate detailing than previous version from what i read \\r\\nhas extra button to create cutting through something or dragging on the floor effect the tips glows extra bright my only concern is replacing the lights when needed and where to go to find them this is a great product and one more for adults vs kids definitely excellent quality this review was collected as part of a promotion this star wars the black series supreme leader kylo ren force fx elite lightsaber is very realistic  it is not any normal light saber  it is a great collectible for a crazy star wars fan like me it has lot of premium features like original light saber from the movie the heavy metal hilt with lot of detail on it it comes with a stand and collector coin it took some time for me to figure out  how to put it together first but then i looked upon the instructions and did exactly as it said i displayed it in stand along with my other star wars collections this is a really awesome the sound effects are very realistic like from the movie press and slide the button on the hilt to activate progressive ignition  molten glow effect and battle clash effect each one of the sound effect is really awesome well build  good quality  advanced led technology is used and it has good sound quality too i bought the game a week ago and play it every day after work it is addictive flexible with what style you want to go photon blades or guns you can improve either way you want to go i just wish you can get the gun and blade quicker in the game which is the only flaw i have seen from the videos online it looked good but the gameplay was off from the storyline and clunky bought because of the anime gameplay is pretty good its a pretty grindy game not a bad shooter but online co op was a downer its literally just a boss fight and its over quickly causr theres 4 of yall and your ai support against 1 enemy i bought this game a couple weeks ago and am so happy about it only thing that would make it better is if it was split screen coop great game overall though and just like the anime i love it its a fun little erd peeson fps the lvling aspect can be a little grind heavy but the core gameplay helps offset that just bought this game in a whim as i wanted a sort of anime themed shooter this is a pretty cool game lots of customization for you character and companion good weapon variation a nice change of pace from the previous games in the series truth be told if you have played any of them dont expect anything outstanding from this title it is a good deal of fun but once the main quest is over unless you have friends to play with online you can put this title down and move on i bought this a few weeks ago and i’m loving the storyline i gotten this game a few weeks ago and i was blown away by it its an awesome game top left minus button did not work returned next day i bought this refurbed joy con online and it had left drift out of the box  after a very smooth and satisfying exchange at the local gamestop this replacement refurb is good  slight forward drift but not really bad and no where near as bad as the other  all in all a good experience works ok definitely has drift issues and i will probably have to swap it out you all got ripped off in the trade in i took the controller home paired it with my switch and went to calibrate the joystick when you do this the system ask you push down on the which joystick you want to calibrate when i pushed down on the joystick it would recognize that i was pushing down on went to the other setting to test all the buttons to see if the system would register the buttons being pressed all of them work except when trying to push down the joystick i returned it the next day controller is in good working condition cashier also said i have 30 days to exchange it if something would go wrong the single joy con was about 30 so you’re not gonna get any kind of deal buying used i just didn’t want to spend the 60 for a pair of brand new ones i only needed one i love nintendo switch my original left joycon got permanently out of alignment and could no longer be properly recalibratedso finding this was great it works perfectly and i have been enjoying being able to play in handheld or tv mode without the cursor or my character suddenly just moving all over the place i bought this joycon earlier this month to replace the one my daughter lost i picked up a pre owned left joy con controller only to discover it has a drag in the toggle and isnt very responsive at times i recommend not buying preowned product was faulty have to return it and see if i can get my money back but i don’t have the receipt thank you i bought this a few days ago for my 8 year old son  it works great i busted up the old left one up but this made up for it i would have loved them but they didnt hook up to the ps4 but i got a platinum headset instead received and out of the box would not take a charge or function in any way ended up swapping them out for an astro set dead on arrival tons of reviews about failed batteries and charging failures should have researched it before wasting that much on a paper weight best headsets ive ever used  easy to use sturdy and an affordable price this headset looks fancy and awesome but the sound quality is pretty horrible compared to their cheaper competitors save your monies they are great and work better then last ones no off at all they work good solid headset just a bit bulky other than that it works like a dream works great love the sound quality and features of the head set didn’t work right out of box didn’t work after charged for over 24 hours didn’t work means didn’t power on at all i went with playstation gold headset instead and love it the output of sound quality  clarity is far superior than any other headphone models out there comfort  snug to the fit for any great gaming experience my son loves this pop it brings him tremendous joy bought this for my little nephew he loves pikachu the funko itself was excellent the box was in mint condition i would totally recommend this for a friend this review was collected as part of a promotion i honestly did not know what to expect as this was my first lightsaber i was however pleasantly surprised it is super cool it lights up really bright and the sound is super loud when holding it feels very sturdy it is for sure well made when swinging it feel very balanced this is for sure a very neat collectors item cant go wrong with a pikachu funko pop its cute and it sits lol this review was collected as part of a promotion this is a couple steps above any other lightsaber with details and enhanced electronics that sets this apart from others on the market the handle is heavier than what i expected it provides weight and feels more realistic than plastic feels i love the effect of the colored orbs that run through with each swish or button push and when it makes contact the sound effects match what i’ve come to expect from the movies the three blades securely fit into the fasteners and are very sturdy it really is a well made piece of equipment i am not very happy with the stand while it does a nice job of presenting the lightsaber forward and at a tilt it isn’t completely sturdy as a fan i definitely love to have this on display but i do worry about it falling i also feel that batteries should have been included overall i definitely recommend this to fellow fans for its very well made design sound and light effects and the wow factor it’s really cool price is a little high compared but it looks nice in my collection this review was collected as part of a promotion after using the kylo ren elite fx lightsaber the hilt the sounds the effects and the color are all exceptional i definitely love how the hilt is real metal and feels like how a lightsaber would actually feel the main blade itself is fantasic and how it has led’s inside of it the side blades however are a bit lackluster you can see the led strips through the side blades which is only a minor fault also the assembly itself is a bit difficult in understanding how to correctly screw the blades in correctly otherwise this is an amazing product and would recommend it to people wanting to buy a lightsaber kawaii desu this review was collected as part of a promotion my adult  son is a huge star wars fan so he was thrilled to play with kylo ren  elite lightsaber its not like the lightsabers you would buy for a young child this is well made and is for ages 18 it is not flimsy or light but not too heavy to handle for an adult the sound effects are great with clashing and then all the red led lights on the blades that light up well it looks like its from the movie sounds and looks great\\r\\nit comes with a great looking stand you can keep it on when not using it or just to display it this is so realistic looking and sounding great for any star wars fan and collector it arrived quickly and in great condition because it was protected by a carefully made cardboard sleeve for funko gamestop continues to do great work this review was collected as part of a promotion all i can say about this light saber is “wow” i’m blown away by its design and the high quality of materials used in its design it’s as close to a real light saber that you can get the sounds effects are perfectly timed with motion the led effects are very impressive it’s almost exactly what i feel like having a real light saber in my hand would feel like it comes with a nice display stand this light saber requires aa batteries which are not included its a beautiful pop great paint job not box damage all together great condition this review was collected as part of a promotion my husband is a huge star wars fan and kylo ren is one of his favorite characters so theres no mystery he would love this lightsaber it is very realistic it looks just like the real thing from the movies theres lots of red leds in all three blades on this saber so it lights up nice and bright the handle on the sword is made of metal and has some weight on it so this lightsaber isnt flimsy or cheap looking it looks very realistic the sword is powered by three aa batteries that dont come included installing the batteries was pretty easy you just unscrew the bottom of the handle and the batteries go right in there theres two buttons on the swords handle one is to turn the lightsaber on and off and the other is for the clashing sound effects the lightsaber also comes with a nice metal stand so you can display the sword with or without the blades in if you wish the first time we installed the blades into the swords handle they were a bit tricky but after learning how they needed to be lined up and clicked in to lock them in place it was no trouble at all ever since this lightsaber arrived my husband cant stop playing with it the clashing sound effects and the molten effects are really cool it even looks really realistic the way it turns on when you skin around and act like youre sword fighting the lightsaber makes sound effects and pulsates to make it look like youre really in a fight i catch myself playing with it too because it is a lot of fun because it looks and feels so realistic any star wars fan or collector would love to have this displayed in their home it is a great conversation piece he made an excellent addition to my collection my kids think he’s pretty cute this review was collected as part of a promotion weve purchased other light sabers before but this black series supreme leader kylo ren fx elite lightsaber beats them all hands down with its heavy approx 4 lb metal handle and its three hard durable plastic light beams this saber makes you feel like youre using a real fighting sword the over all weight is around 6 lbs and is made of extremely strong plastics and everything fits snuggly and securly into place so no wobbly pieces that might come off during role play\\r\\n\\r\\nthe sound and light effects are terrific too you can have just the motion sounds when youre waving it around or a lava sound that pulses when at rest the lights change when you come in contact with something hopefully just pillows or the couch as do the sound effects at the same time\\r\\n\\r\\nif you have a diehard star wars fan in the family this is the role playing toy to get awesome this review was collected as part of a promotion this star wars kylo ren lightsaber is great the lights go up or down just like a real one would and it has realistic sounds and different light displays for movement it also has its own stand that is very sturdy it was easy to assemble and turn on it does have some weight to it but it is great for collectors and kids alike i recommend this this review was collected as part of a promotion i just love the star wars the black series supreme leader kylo ren force fx elite lightsaber it is truly amazing the handlehilt has a substantial weight to it but it is not too heavy and it is very highly detailed it is very simple to put together and it is by far one of the best lightsabers i have ever seen the light effect is truly amazing and the sounds are just as they would be in the movie it also comes with a very nice stand to display the lightsaber this review was collected as part of a promotion i thought this was going to be some plastic thing for kids  man was i wrong this thing is awesome it has some real weight to it the sounds are great and the light up is very nice it also includes a cool stand for it so i can display it the only issue is when you install the tunes you have to press pretty hard to get it to turn absolutely love that gamestop offers to sell half controllers so you can mix and match comtrollers imstead of buying two of the exact same colors one downside is they do not come with the controller attachment with the wristband like they wpuld if you bought the pair had no prob with the controller so far  it’s def worth picking one up this blue left joycon is amazing the best of the joy con line we only have one blue left joycon but it is amazing asked for a right got sold a left also it was super broken and just sad thanks for nothing gamestop you guys have grown to a size that you aren’t capable of actually maintaining the quality of it’s sad scale down before you vanish mine broke the other night this was covered under warranty worked perfectly thanks it didnt work went back got another one  that one didnt work either it’s a fun  rpg with guns but it’s a bit repetitive bought as a second joy con and was very pleased with quality of used i’ve been playing all the sao games and i gotta say this one is amazing because the story revolves around your created character and the story is as good as hollow realization i would recommend to buy it but wait when it’s on sale preowned price was cheaper but not worth the gamble purchased to use on a trip only to find out the product was defective very dissatisfied bought the game about a week ago and haven’t been able to stop bought this because my left joycon just stopped working and honestly i didn’t want to buy the pair of joycon but it didn’t worked jammed buttons so i returned it my son love the game as soon as he brought he went home and play it the controller works fine and looks good but being used it will most likely have the drifting issue ive been wanting this game for so long and when i started playing it it surpassed my expectations great controls and great story it is amazing how the cannon characters interact with your 2 charactes its a pretty straightforward game with an interesting story that builds on the already existing narrative character customization is significantly better than previous sao games the ggo arc of sao was by far one of my favorites of the series i have played all the sao games and became annoyed that every single one praised kirito every 5 seconds and than left my own character as an after thought not fatal bullet right from the begining yiu make your own avatar and can change it anytime \\r\\nsure kirito asuna shinon and the rest of the gang are here too of course but its not a shrine built to one character\\r\\nthe controls are easy enough to get used to and the tutorial is very helpful and flexible a bit long in the tooth this is not the game to play on a tight schedule the cut scenes will take time i wish it were in english though \\r\\noverall a good game but like any game does crave some improvements i bought this game a little over a week ago and i actually enjoyed it so much that i finished the main questline all in all it was a good game and if you like sword art youll probably enjoy this game i have always enjoyed the franchise and this title does some new things and the new setting has made the combat really fast i am presently enjoying it quite a bit the ai is the worst ive ever seen you can glitch through walls and fall through floors when you get ragdolled by a boss it took 13000 bullets to clear my first dungeon and you have to buy bullets none of this game feels like ggo should  its all glittery and shiny when ggo is supposed to be oily and mechanical the story is awful even for a sword art spin off it is an awesome headset i would definitely reccommend it to someone else the sound quality is amazing and is not hard to connect to your system this headset is comfortable with long battery life and great sound  the wireless feature shows no lag and great range  itd be nice if there was bluetooth model so i could use my them on my phone but otherwise the rig 800hs is a solid headset the head set is great light weight great on the ears sound is awesome along with the bluetooth but the issues i had was the onoff switch broke easily and went to replace a total of 4 times cause the replacements ethier did not work or did not charge  i would of given it a 5 star but because of the issues i have it a 3 star not 100 most comfortable over the head but ear muffs are comfy just not really impressed i traded for the turtle beach 700 at the store at no charge not impressed with it either cheap quality not that great sound on day 6 of owning this headset it completely stopped working audio completely cut out and couldn’t do anything to get it back 1010 do not recommend the sound quality on these are amazing i can hear things in game my other friends cant during gameplay and i barely have the volume up its amazing definitely gives you an edge on any battle royale games one of the most comfortable headsets ive ever purchase would highly recommend them while this headset did have pretty good sound quality battery life and range it advertises it having the capability of controlling the sound and chat mixture however it does not control them independently its either all on or all off great headset for the price solid build sounds amazing comfortable ear muffs and headband long battery life and lots of controls on headset highly recommend for a wireless headset bought it pre owned for a good price and works fantastic my son used his birthday money to pick up this game he is a big fan of the anime he loves the game and the story being 9 he finds the relationship building portion of the game hilarious my old joycon stopped working and i had to go buy a new one and this one works perfectly i bought this game 2 weeks ago it has pretty good graphics gameplay is pretty fun i bought this last week and when i came home i realized that the l button didn’t work i was really disappointed because the gamestop employees never warned me about the l button being broken big bummer its pretty fun though theres a lot of grinding involved and typical sao moments had to replace 2 days after purchase and a week later the replacement one is doing the same thing now that being said i do think the games multi player needs some work my switch console had come with a slightly defective left joycon out of the box since it wasnt a huge deal i had found a workaround for it but recently it suddenly hadgotten more defects to the point where i couldnt use it thankfully gamestop had a left joycon in stock that i could get as a replacement it worked absolutely perfect and still is creating your own character makes it more enjoyable than other sao games having the same problem with this blue joy con\\r\\nwhen i brought it in to switch it out for another one i almost gave up after last song but they went back to the original game style as hallow realization i love farming and free roaming to do as i please while also completing the story i bought this relatively recently and the controller is great but it makes my character move forward on its own consistently my grandson purchased this and his review was \\r\\nit is awesome i bought it because the one that came with my switch stopped working nintendo didnt repair it after i sent it in so i had to buy this one works well for an anime based video game it has not disappointed the game is fun to grind out some levels and try different guns \\r\\n\\r\\nplot is a it much ive found myself skipping almost all the side conversations no misfunctions with the controller saved a buttload by buying it used can’t beat that about this about a week ago and its a good game theres a lot of talking scenes especially in the beginning of the game but after you get into the action it is very good good controls no major complaints though i do wish some of the events that they talk about you actually have to take action in instead of just watching them talk about it we were at my daughters soccer game and my younger son had his nintendo switch with him a few weeks prior he had closed the switch in the arm rest of the car and mangled the left blue controller we had manahlged to piece back together or so we thought so while at the game he was running around and some how the black knobnon the controller fell off luckily there was a game stop only minutes away and instead of having to pay for a new set or single controller the store rep offered a referphished one at a much lower cost\\r\\nquick easy and inexpensive crisis corrected in under 5 minutes\\r\\nthank you game stop\\r\\nmike love the graphics and by far the best sword art online game if you like the logitech g930s but want better battery life better range and the ability to adjust the volume from your ps4 without having to open the menu this is the headset for you i wish they had an auxiliary port oh well probably the best headset i’ve owned to date i’ve used ps gold hyperx cloud stinger and even beats for gaming but these have been the most comfortable and given the most quality sound so far the headset is very light weight and super comfortable the big issue i had was the volume the headset is simply not loud enough you can adjust the settings to to make it a little louder but then it sounds hollow and still isn’t very loud i would not recommend i thought that you would be able to seperate how loud voice chat is compared to the game volume so far the in game voice completely muted game volume which is annoying the headset will still connect and stay on in rest mode the power button is s little flimsy and pushhold button might be better great head phones i am so glad i switched to using these sounds good just wish they would get a little bit louder great headset especially with the dolby atmos free activation included  very comfortable and will not sweat during longer gaming sessions couldn’t get the chatgame volume to work it would either turn all the way or turn all the sound off no i wasn’t confusing the volume control either tried different usb cables charging ports etc no indicator light and no charge this review was collected as part of a promotion i couldnt wait to get this going put it all together and was like why wont it light up then i realized the blades werent in all the way so make sure of that push in and rotate all 3 of them works just fine after it has amazing sound and it lights up a dark room its pretty heavy as well as a star wars fan this was amazing i couldnt stop playing with it and my fiance was like seriously as he was watching a movie i was like fight me as i was pretending we were in a star wars movie lol holds up on stand great i like the battery pack it all is amazing instructions could have written words on what to do but doesnt take away how fun and great this lightsaber is this review was collected as part of a promotion i cannot begin to say how much i love my light saber it takes 3 aa batteries thats it it makes so many cool sounds exactly like the movie i also can display the lightsaber in its stand or mount it on my wall this thing is so real looking too a true addition to any star wars fan collection thats for sure its amazing with the different guns to use it never get dull  the stat system ties into all areas of game keeps me entertained the game difficulty in mission with  krito and his friends if u liked previous ones here u go another one but with guns  multiplayer the same pretty much u can make ur own toon in this one without harem mans voice it is not for anybody the game specific targets anime fans more specifically sao fans bought this game a week ago and i just cant put it down the graphics are so much better and realistic than the other games not your typical sao game a must buy i bought this game for my boyfriend and he loves it i bought sword art online fatal bullet a month ago and i am extremely happy i bought the game while the story and characters are a bit stale and empty i enjoyed the gameplay and combat feature i have always love sao game and this one seem like it was better than the other one after 19 hours i couldnt take any more  all these kids talking in japanese while im trying to read in english and all they talk about is playing a game within the game youre playing and meeting in real life  there are some points where the story gets you amped up  a character says hey  i know where an awesome sniper rifle is  lets go get it and instead of you venturing forth to get it it just continues to show you two talking then says something like wow that was a fun journey getting that sniper rifle and thats it  the dungeons are big square corridors where you fight 4 different robotlooking enemies  a robot guy a robot spider a flying robot and sometimes a boss  in the regular world you fight different colored robot guys scorpions and bees  sometimes a sandworm and a robotech thing   the movement is very smooth and the graphics are very nice  i could have done without the two hours of dialogue in the beginning of the game  i just wanted to shoot some stuff but all everyone wanted to do was talk  if youre a fan of the anime and spamming the shoot  reload buttons then i guess this is for you  if youre looking for an rpg shooter with a story you can follow id go someplace else     oh and for some reason if you save another player enough times in battle they fall asleep in your room in the game in their underwear  maybe its a culture thing that im just not getting i liked the game it was good gameplay is good also story is god like i have never had issues with controllers through gamestop before after they got their new testing device but they cannot test switch joycons yet as it stands every pre owned joy on i have purchased from them has been total garbage prices are getting out of hand for these gamestop i will not be renewing my pro membership when i can get a fully working non preowned item similar to this for basically the same price everything works fine on this  we needed a replacement of the old controller that i busted bought this to complete my blue set of joy con and it works perfectly the b button only works every other time you press it this purchase was a waste of my time as i returned it as soon as i got it really stinks that a game less then a year old is already broken  constantly sticking and my character just keeps on moving  will not function most of the time and is the weakest link to a game with nothing but frustration when i have to redo the link over and over its insane to sell these at the same price as new and not include wrist straps straps are 7 dollars apiece i just got pre owned blue left and right and neither had a strap comfort for hours sound quality on point the only thing is every time you get on ps4 you’ll have to adjust your output my friends can’t hear me so i have to adjust it  i am not sure how to set it on a permanent basis but it’s my first wireless headset can’t beat the sound quality they sound amazing and they are very comfortable the only bad side they will disconnect and it has a lag for a couple of seconds while playing other than that they are pretty good it is an all around great headset  it’s a little heavy not as heavy as the astros a40’s but still heavy  i wish it worked on both consoles that’s it’s only bad side i do not wish to have to buy the other console version for me too use it for both consoles  i think they need to rethink their business strategy but other than that great headset i think this is a great product i love all the things it has and it’s comfortable great headset super comfortable to wear feels light on your head and the headphones themselves are really comfortable and sound great i like the different sound settings and the battery life is pretty good for being a wireless headset i like that they self adjust to your head and it doesn’t pull your hair or anything decent headset with clear audio clear mic with not much feedback issues at all best headset ever purchased best thing about them is the battery life the battery on a full charge lasts 375 hours     i left the headset full volume streaming video and i figured the advertised 24 was funny   no it lasted 375 hours    sound is excellent  coming from astro a50 a20 a40 the sound and comfort are excellent  range is excellent  mic is excellent   battery is outstanding    i’m buying a second pair for pc took mea while to figure out how to make rhe connection work also they make my ears hurt because the actual ear phones part is pretty small ive envested 75 hours into this game and have loved every second of it i love everything sword art online to the novels anime and the games like its past games fatal bullet is amusingly well done this game is a must play has a great story this is pretty dope like the show and looks like ggo it’s an excellent headset a gaming person know i am talking about it’s an amazing headset amazing love how lightweight and comfortable it feels as comfortable as they are the volume doesnt get very loud as turtle beach headphones unfortunately does it job and for the price not mad at it battery life seems long good sounds while not true surround sound few are on ps4 the sound stage is impeccable the comfort is great \\r\\ninitially i felt they may be too quiet but after a few minutes of gameplay i was reaching for the volume to turn it down\\r\\n\\r\\ni really appreciate the chat mix dial rig included when not playing with others you can turn it down to nearly off as an unadvertised treat the chat dial can be held in the max position to mute all sound which is great if you dont want to take the headset off when the wife is talking these headphones are so comfortable to wear and the sound quality is amazing as advertised from noise canceling to clear sounding headphones well worth the purchase works good and thinking about buying another one i would recommend this to all not as many features as the stealth 800 but far more comfortable sound isn’t bad but it didn’t have any comfortably for someone with glasses horrible audio issues and not very good quality mic this is a great product the sound is fantastic my only complaint is after about 40 minutes it gets a tad bit uncomfortable good product the mic does need a little bit more work friends have trouble hearin me at times other than that solid purchase there excellent and  block surrounding noise with a comfortable adjustable fit broke in 2 days  had a loud loud high pitch ring coming out of right earphone  my ear still hurts to this day because of it it’s worth the price with an easy set up comfortable and simple adjustability sturdy build that doesn’t get heavy after hours of wear and excellent audiochat quality you’ll definitely be getting your money’s worth holy cow amazing secong only to astro a50 in terms of sound honestly astounding battery life and very durable with breathable ear padding best headset for its price point they suck had em not even a month and the mic went out this headset is very comfortable and durable  the sound quality is awesome  i love the feature of having all of the controls on the headset and within easy reach best headsets i’ve ever had hands down i use them while playing cod you can hear everything from footsteps to bullets goin past your head the surround sound on this headset is 5 star this game is a masterpiece  fantastic game works properly in great condition came very timely as well the game is great but i was sold a used copy as new nice way to change up to the alttp formula that nintendo tends to put in every zelda game do not buy new  gamestop will just send a used copy with either no seal  no case at all and just put a “new” sticker on the case  envelope best zelda game fun addictive and all you want from a zelda game the best portable zelda title since link’s awakening so much fun great blend of old zelda games and modern mechanics loved it love this game and glad i got the original case this is in excellent condition from being a used game a beautiful love letter to the legend of zelda link to the past this should be in everyones library   it is a sequel of sorts to its snes counterpart game not directly a sequel but in the same general era which in my opinion puts it as a sequel however nintendo has not oficially said that only that it is a zelda title and each zelda title is related to the other zelda titles with the exception of hyrule warriors which is in its one separate storyline and universe decent headset was recommended by gamestop employee did not like fit and at times is to low in volume would not buy again better than any turtlebeach headset premium robust surround sound with clear and crisp chat communication long battery life and comfortable on the head especially for someone who wears glasses no static noise from usb connection like turtlebeach headsets this is a high quality headset at an affordable price next best thing to tb headsets awesome for the price these are very useful and not just for gaming i make beats on my spare time and by far these have had the best surround sound quality as well has highlow ranges would definitely recommend to anyone who would want them i have had astro’s a40 i have had all turtle beaches and none compare to how good the rig 800hs are the price and quality of these are great and the sound is amazing  i charge them maybe once a week the battery life on these are like no other i have them for my xbox and i bought another pair for my ps4 only complaint is would be nice if one pair worked for both systems i’m very pleased with the quality at the price i paid great sound and not hearing myself when i use the mic doesn’t bother me as much as others gave it 4 stars because it doesn’t get super loud i like headphones that if all the way up i’m almost uncomfortable and these aren’t anywhere close all in all great headset for the money not very loud at all on the ps4 wouldn’t buy them again if they were 20 it is a very comfortable headset lightweight and sounds great it also has a great battery in it i recommend it and have ran into 0 cons about this headset i recently purchased the headset and im very impressed with the sound and clarity extremely comfortable very good on hearing everything very clear mic and they look awesome i’ve only charged it one time and it lasted me a whole week i play everyday with it excellent wired headphones  excellent frequency response impedence is high so its best to use with a headphone amp if possible but still good for use with portable devices at moderate volumes\\r\\n\\r\\nnote the model is harx900 excellent game so much fun always great for zelda fans this game is surprisingly fun i takes a lot of elements from the original link to the past game on the snes and adds a bunch of new stuff some dont work but a lot are cool new features fourth best in the series because it only took seven hours to beat this game exceeded my expectations  i played link to the past when i was young and this game made me feel nostalgic and at the same time excited since it took place in the same world  i highly recommend this game  well worth playing you wont be disappointed great game with great visuals in such a small package i like how you go between worlds and um how you can explore more stuff do i have to tell you its fun because of dungeons son officially overtook orcarina of time as my favorite zelda title highly recommend as someone who discovered zelda later in life this game has been a treat i’ve played the regular nintendo versions and most recently the 3ds rereleases this felt like the best of both worlds the better graphics while maintaining the traditional style felt seamless the great story telling of ocarina of time mixed with nostalgic hyrule of old i wasn’t a fan of majoras mask and so far haven’t found much carry over into this version which for me is a plus it’s semi open world as you can roam on your own time completing side quest or tackle the main story utilizing the town and its people to solve riddles mazes and boss battles the graphics still hold up in 2019 for my eyes at least i’ve seen the new links awakening and while stunning it’s not difficult to immerse myself back into this game dated graphics don’t distract from the game play like some 3ds games the 3d helps with that as this is the only game i’ve been able to play with the 3d on the whole time without getting a headache overall it’s exactly as expected which makes it near perfect and it’s an easy sell if you’re already a zelda fan best 3ds game i have played so far fun installment of the franchise this is a must have for fans of a link to the past i love how this game looks and feels when playing it gret headphones sure but i lost my receipt for my 2 year warranty i bought these a few months ago but now keep saying connected  not connected and others in the party can hear it ive been told every now again they are making a loud noise i cant hear as well in parties\\r\\n  i have loved this headset but out of the blue have started messing up which is sad because how much i have loved these not as loud and clear as i would have hoped for for the  but super comfy fit really comfortable \\r\\nyou could wear for long period of time \\r\\nand great sounds love this headset it gets the job done micwise but it really shines with how light it is and how long one charge lasts went through 5 gaming sessions before it dropped from high to med on the charge super comfortable to wear highly recommend speer comfortable long lasting battery and great sound quality hearing movement from other players is a real advantage i thought at first they seemed cheap because of the plastic head strap and the way the ear pads click in place  but these are actually really rugged and i think they are going to far outlast the sony headphones they replaced  they are comfortable and the battery holds a charge for over 12 hours  the cloth ear pads are much better than the pleather style pads that always end up flacking apart and getting fake black leather flecks all over your face  i liked these so much i bought a second pair for my son well i’d say that this is my 2nd pair of wireless headset that i have owned and the first pair was astro 20’s and comparing them  the rig 800hs are by far a way better purchase the durability and the time between charges is day and night the rig’s 800hs are definitely the way to go and make me enjoy having a wireless headset before i went wireless i was using the hyper x plug into controller style i went through 2 pair of them breaking the mute button which on all 3 pair is a flip up and down design and the astro 20’s the mixer box started to act up not allowing me to even turn the headset on and always needed to be charged but i also game a lot about 5 hours a day or more and i have purchased and used all of these headset products within the last year and so i feel i definitely can give my honest opinion on which is the best and hands down it’s therig 800hs  and definitely would recommend anyone to buy this product now the hyper x plug n play are great buy for 50 as long as you are very gentle with the flip up and down mic but the astro 20 and rig 800hs are about the same price point at 150 and i say that there’s no comparison 800hs smash the astro 20’s opinion of a playstation 4 gammer absolutely love this headset seriously contemplating getting one for the xbox as well very good sound quality also good sound proofing battery life is extremely long lasting only complaint is wish the volume would go louder its a fantastic game any new player will take 40 hours to 100 everything it has great puzzles in each temple that test your ingenuity with the tools you can buy the graphics are quite nice especially for a handheld title i would recommend it to anyone wanting to get into the zelda series or anyone who likes simple and nonlinear rpgs great remake the graphics are amazing just as fun as when i played the original on my gameboy in 5th grade amazing game that really brungs back memories of the snes days this game was a gem a musthave for any 3ds owner i had this game before but lost it i’m glad to have it again its a solid zelda game and a great 3ds game to own it has a lot of things you can find and collect rented the game before but i like the gameplay and the style of it this game is very nostalgic of a link to the past but does lightyears more than cater to your past the freedom of exploration is remarkable in the zelda franchise as a link between worlds introduces the item rental shop where you can rent any item and solve puzzles or even dungeons any time you want the puzzles are some of the best in the series with the ability to merge in and out walls and the new world of lorule this game is probably the best game on the 3ds right now and you should definitely pick it up it’s wellpriced it’s fun and it’s an experience i totally recommend this product great game works great in 3d its a fresh take on the old zelda games this game is so fun and creative the concept of jumping between worlds to reach places that are otherwise unreachable to save the world is really fun the storyline is really good and a lot of fun to play i played this a while back when i borrowed it and because of how much i enjoyed it decided to purchase my own copy the other day playing it again brings back memories looking forward to playing to the end decent comfortable headset despite the ear pads not being leather long lasting battery is a plus im unsure gow they compare the the turtle beach in the same price range but i have no complaints these also work on pc they are amazing batterie life lasts forever i rarely have to charge them an i play close to 8 hours amazing sound and mic quality good battery life only issue is sometimes i have to unplugreplug the receiver in after rest mode i was very skeptical about these  but gamestop has a 30 day return policy so i figured if i didnt like them i could always bring them back  5 days later and i still love these headphones they are very easy to set up and they are one of the few wireless headsets that have an optical cable to allow you to use them on the ps4 but still get sound through to streamlabs obs  this has been a problem for a long time but these fix that issue  the directional sound is great  the comfort is great  the only con imo is how you adjust the headband  but i can look past that because everything else is great it is an amazing headset that’s durable and convenient definitely worth the money had these for about 4 months no problems battery life is stellar great quality headset with unbeatable comfort and sound quality this headset will last you for years to come ive been through astros turtle beaches and razer headsets and this one in my opionion beats the competition very easy to set up the headset also has amazing range so you can go almost anywhere in your house and not lose signal battery last 24 hours and thats not an exaggeration the headset also has multiple sound options and has a little voice reminder when the battery gets low you can not go wrong with headset even for the price you will not be dissatisfied hands down the best headset ive ever worn by far the most comfortable really long battery life the sound is great it can blow out your ear drums lol it works on my pc as well i recommend this headset above any other the only down fall is it has a digital optical cable and if you dont have a ps4 pro then you better have a tv with the digital optical output other wise the chatvolume control will adjust the same i just recently purchased 3 pairs of these headphones usually that would be an indicator that they are of shoddy craftsmanship quite the contrary one pair is for me the other two are for my wife and brother as an audiophile who takes the sound quality of my videogames very seriously the plantronics rig 800hs for the ps4 delivers a full package where even the first party sony platinum headset did not in comparison the rig 800 hs provides a wider range of frequencies on both the low and high end of the sonic spectrum if i can hear bow skipping techniques on a droptuned double bass i am a very happy listener additionally the visual confirmation with the boom microphone showing whether the listener is muted is more convenient than the onetone button of the aforementioned sony platinum headphones all of the typical buttons have been traded for an intuitive set of manual rotary dials which allow for master volume and mix between party chat and game audio the addition of 4 builtin eq settings is a great touch and i find that the seismic setting is more of a quality audio enhancer that a simple overthetop bass boost like listening through beats i still have yet to run down the battery the bragging point of an upto24hourbatterylife seems well earned for gamers who find themselves a tad obsessed from time to time the biggest selling point for me besides amazing sound they breathe the aroundtheear design uses a very comfortable perforated cloth and foam to allow for a maximum amount of breathing around ones ears pair that with its incredibly lightweight design and its almost like youre not wearing a headset at all  its a real shame that gamestop is throwing all of its advertising money into promoting those mediocre turtle beach recon 200s when they have these in their inventory the plantronics rig 800hs are truly a superior set of headphones comfortable compatible with my ps3 as well amazing audio i absolutely loved this game it reminded me of links awakening but with better graphics this is a must have game i hope it gets ported to the switch if the 3ds is dead i had yet to play this i loved a link to the past as a kid and with this being a spiritual successor to lttp so when i got the opportunity i bought it right away its fun but not exactly the best zelda game ever this is a great zelda game originally this game was to be a remake of tloz a link to the past the team decided to make it its own game it is a blast to play and the mix of familiar with new things is a great reason to pick up this game best zelda game ever top down style is awesome simple to learn yet still awesome great zelda game “gimmick” is well done and fun to use a must play if you still have your 3ds its classic zelda gameplay lots of puzzles and action to keep you busy for quite a while amazing new take on zelda awesome game with cool new ability it’s probably the best game i’ve gotten no wonder the legend of zelda games are popular but also fun my son loves this and it takes us back to the snes game so its a win win great game takes place in same world as oink to the past everything sounds good i can hear thin gs a lot more clearly coming from the default playstation earpiece to this was amazing incredibly comfortable  good if you have a large head sound is amazing however dialing in your party can be difficult during gameplay  i can turn the dial all the way to chat and game sound still overcomes the chat communication at times the audio is very nice sounding for what it is the 4 onboard eq options help for different situations but the mic boom is so far away from your face that you sound like youre 20 feet away from the people you talk to it is good and all it just it sometimes isnt loud enough to hear the game music works great on ps4 still trying to figure out how to put it to the xbox as well if it is possible it’s comfortable and lasts a good amount of time love this headset battery life is outstanding and its very comfortable for both my glasses and piercings this headset has great sounds lefts rights good bass  you can hear sounds all around you great for fortnite mic is really good connects great with my ps4 most confortable headset and one of the best sounding headsets i have used to date lets just see how long they hold up to my use battery life has been incredible they are versatile they work well and are comfortable great fit long lasting battery and great sound capabilities the chatgame volume dial doesn’t work right for me thus the 4 star rating all in all a great headset this shelf is attractive and decent quality but is way over priced for what it is this review was collected as part of a promotion the honeycando horizontal floating wall shelf is a icando it is so easy to assemble and install that i didn’t need help from anyone the ledge is a decent depth and the shelf hangs securely in the wall i would recommend this shelf for anyone who wants a little decorative shelf but is not the necessarily a diyer this review was collected as part of a promotion this shelf is super cute and sturdy it makes for a perfect bathroom shelf the only thing i dont like is the shadowing from the top of the shelf but not a huge issue either way it makes for a cute decoration this review was collected as part of a promotion the horizontal floating wall shelf gave my glam room the perfect update that i needed it’s so simple clean and sleek looking i am able to display some of my favorite perfumes on this shelf assembly was a snap the natural wood look makes it pop this review was collected as part of a promotion the shelf is wellmade and attractive i personally would prefer the wood shelf to be a little bit darker\\r\\n\\r\\nas far as functionality it doesn’t have much the frame is just there to add visual appeal but you really can only use it for the shelf space which is small it’s almost like it’s more of a decorative element to have the frame around it and that requires a lot of hardware in the wall to keep it secure\\r\\n\\r\\nthe directions are clear and it’s easy to install it just took a little extra time because you’re using heavy duty bolts that go into the wall\\r\\n\\r\\npersonally i don’t feel that the amount of work going into putting it in the wall and the holes you put in the wall are worth it for the small amount of storage and decoration that the product gives this review was collected as part of a promotion beautiful wall shelf i love the style of this shelf its simple but unique it really does look like its floating it is very easy to install on the wall and feels very sturdy i dont feel uncomfortable putting my breakable products on it it is spacious enough for a few knick knacks candles or even small plants i highly recommend this shelf to anyone looking for a floating wall shelf that has a unique look this review was collected as part of a promotion i received the honey cando horizontal floating shelf   it was so easy to assemble and it came with all the needed tools and screws to assemble and hang  i love the color and the way it looks mounted on the wall  i would definitely recommend this product this review was collected as part of a promotion this filled the little wall space i needed with added purpose the shelf was a little smaller than i anticipated but is functional for holding some selected  office supplies \\r\\neasy to follow assembly instructions come with all tools to complete except wall mounting this review was collected as part of a promotion my son has a smaller room but we still fit a queen sized bed in it that way he cant outgrow it and it can be used for company but because we did that we need space saving but highly functional furniture pieces we have a mail holder shelf on one side that fits his tablet books etc attached to the wall this shelf is perfect for his cup and glasses we had been searching for something like this it is even modern and built well too style and function my son absolutely loves it the only negative we could find was that we had to use our own anchors the anchors included really did not fit the included screws my husband is a master electrician and carpenter so we had some on hand we still give this shelf 5 stars no doubt about it i received this to test but all opinions are honest and my own this review was collected as part of a promotion i absolutely love my floating wall shelf it was extremely easy to assemble and hang on my wall it adds a pop in my decor and great just to have a shelf to decorate i love the sophisticated look and how it adds an extra bit of style to my wall it is extremely durable and very sturdy i never thought of using something like this to decorate my walls but creates a nice simple but sophisticated look to my room awesome game very unique with its puzzles music graphics and story got to be careful with this one because like the other zelda games it is very addictive you will have loads of fun with albw i was blown away at how much fun this game is as a kid who grew up on super nes this game brings me tons of nostalgia as well as a great new story and beautiful graphics one of my favorite zelda games  a pure joy to play this game brings back a nostalgia feeling for those that played the old zelda games this game is based on my favorite zelda game it plays just like link to the past the world is familiar and really takes me back i havent had a chance to play it myself yet but ive watched other people play it before and im certainly excited to jump in to it this is my second play through of this title and i can say it has been just as enjoyable as the first time the puzzles are challenging enough that when you solve them you feel like you’ve accomplished something i loved a link to the past so this game has a special place in my heart just the old feel of that with the new villains and such i love it a lot like the classic zelda games from my childhood its pretty good so far best zelda game ever nintendo should make more in the same style excellent headset with superior comfort sound is great options are good best bang for your buck the best headphones i have ever owned and i have had all the turtle beach cod themed headsets the comfort and battery are superior the sound is above average for sure the durability is the only question i have as they don’t feel as though they would survive a thrashing but with a careful approach these will be just fine this headset feels cheaply made entirely of plastic the ear cups pull totally off of the headband in order to adjust the size over your head and the headband has no cushioning and become a little uncomfortable over longer play sessions sound quality seems ok otherwise i paid 12999 but i feel like the price should be more like 4999 because they feel cheap overall i would not purchase these again you have to have the chat sound blasting in your ear to hear the game sound when you turn the knob either way from center it acts like a master volume and make both hard to hear i bought this about two months ago and it is the best sound quality that i’ve ever had in a headset so i bought the rig 800 hs headset a couple months ago they’ve been really awesome no major complaints at all they fit great comfortable to wear for extended hours of gaming on my ps4 pubg the sounds are great and let you know where the enemy is firing from the two super small issues i have with this headset compared to my rig 800 lx for my xbox one s the two minor issues is the the max volume on my 800 hs doesn’t feel as loud as my 800 lx along with that after really playing for a couple of hours some sounded really different so i put the product boxes next to each other and the rig 800 hs so not have 3d surround sound and that was a minor issue but having months playing the 800 hs it is an issue but not a big or huge issue but i am thoroughly pleased would definitely recommend this product 100 i bought this head set a month ago i’m going to say it’s worth the money very comfortable not tight on the head or around the ears sounds great in cod and fortnight great quality build study great simulated surround sound love this headset not sure if its my luck or what but i bought this headset and it worked great for about a week and the mic went out took back to game stop for a swap out of the same headset and the same problem happened again within a month i really recommendheadset can hear everything i can adjust the volume perfectly i recommend them this review was collected as part of a promotion i bought this shelf so i could have a special spot up high to put my wax warmer so the kids cant get to it  it has a bit of a rustic look to it which i just love  and the size is exactly what i needed without being too small or too big  over all i just love this shelf this review was collected as part of a promotion horizontal floating wall shelf is very sturdy and really nice easy to put together and easy to hang this review was collected as part of a promotion the honeycando  horizontal floating shelf is perfect for any small wall space where you are needing to add small decor it was a breeze to put together and install one person can easily put it together and add it in a pinch i had been looking for a shelf for our guest bathroom and couldn’t find the “right” one after searching as soon as it came i knew it was what i had been looking for it goes perfectly and takes up minimal space the color and quality of it is great highly recommend this floating shelf i’ve had this headset for a little over two months and it is the best headset i’ve ever owned well worth the money the rig 800hs headset is really good super comfy on ears and head mic is very clear to people i chat with they unfortunately know what i really sound like now the sound quality in game is really good as well hadnt considered wireless in the past but glad i have them battery lasts longer than i do playing make sure headset is completely charged before setting up on the ps4 everything works better on setup when you do bought this item based on sources and reviews and here is mine now it is great love it worth every penny  quality sound is amazing the design is dope  its very comfortable when worn wireless i must say i cant complain at all highly recommend to get it to those who havent already great headseti love this headset makes gaming a whole new experience what can i say didn’t work when i took it out of the box got for christmas they are amazingly comfortable and i can even use with my hearing aid light weight good fit easy setup easy controls gamevoices volume worked really well when first installed but for some reason doesnt work as well now but i have had that happen with other headsets with the same setup i love this so much i originally got the turtle beach 600 head set but the person at the gamestop i was at told me i should get this one instead and i am so happy i did except for a little lag in larger chats this rig is perfect so far so good the three people i bought these for have enjoyed them and so have i ive been to busy to test myself but if they like them i know i will also this was a decent title to play but most of the dungeons didnt feel as long as they could have been  and while i felt most of them were too easy i did find two of them to be annoyingly difficult  not because they were clever but because their layouts werent as clear cut  and dont get me started on that stupid stealth section  all and all its a decent title and itll keep your busy in your off time if you needed something to fill it  oh i enjoyed the 2d transformation and would like to see this power return in a future title  that was a cool one reminds me of a link to the past very different from the other zelda games glad i bought it love the game little difficult for the 4yr old i bought it for but im thoroughly enjoying it not what i expected but an excellent game anyway i expected a remaster of a link to the past but it was not it has a different story different mechanics and a slightly different map i still enjoyed playing the game and if youre a fan of 2d zelda games its a must have loved it great game reminds me of link to the past one of the best on 3ds and a fantastic game in the zelda series bought a few days ago and already almost beat it love the puzzle like play and twist in the plot of the game i loved it like i do every zelda game and even though the ending and characters were different it just kept reminding me of link to the past it felt like a copy and paste version only with new parts edited in so for me compared others it didnt seem like anything i havent seen before just couldnt beat breath of the wild play it before and had to play again great in the zelda series very fun game i am so used to link to the past that it throws me off when i play this game which makes it even more fun i like the comic mischief and the graphicsanimation very colorful and rich i was so excited to receive this for my son but when we opened the package today it came dented in two places its a very nice bottle but such a shame that it came damaged just like it for the nintendo style and great item for game room very nice i really like it holds a full o\\r\\nbottle of water is a good water bottle to have it matches my backpack cause is an nes too i just want to get because it matches my backpack super comfortable and the sound is amazeballs by far the best headset i’ve ever had sound quality could be upgraded while its a nice feature to select between chat and game audio on the fly and adjust the volumes towards one other the function itself robs you from the imersion of footsteps such as in fps games also the max volume output could be inhanced this price point should of been better overall in sound and build and its just lackluster i bought these headphones a month ago although i am still getting use to them i like how they help me play better tested them out it would not show up under audio devices but after redoing connection it picked up chat and game volume rocker on my unit are backwards for some reason but work great sounds good as well bass lacks a bit no surround sound but can still pin where enemy fire comes from coming from the sony platinum headset witch band snapped on mines these are not that bad would have love to try their 800hd but game stop dont carry them sucks xbox gets surround sound model for same price as these protip use the digital and usb connection as instructed make sure your input and output is set to the headset your done bottom control is overall volume top control adjust party and game top for game bottom for party best headset hands down i would put these up against the best that are out there i play cod and needed a headset that would let me hear my enemy’s  footsteps not only do i hear them i can pin point where they are coming from and i can also hear gunshots that are coming from across the maps it feels like your in the game for real if you want to take your game to the next level invest in these and you will rise to the top i also love the easy set up and fiber optic cable it comes with ive had this headset for a little over a month now i dont regret a single second of it it has dual volume controls to support live chat and gameplay i can hear my friends crystal clear while listening to the enemy run through the room next to me with no problem i bought this cause my cheap wired one was really uncomfortable so i splurged and bought this it has amazing comfortability sounds good and isnt very bulky i love it extremely comfortable  clear and accurate sound  plenty of bass boom and excellent sound location  all my friends say that i sound way better now tried lots of headsets and this one was by far the most comfortable  plantronics knows what they are doing i bought this headset a week ago and they haven’t failed they are super nice and heavy duty compared to my turtle beaches yeah i know turtle beaches are supposed to be the stuff the rig 800 hs beat them they have easy instructions hooking them up basically self explanatory sound quality is great super comfy around the ears and head i can wear them for hours on end without being uncomfortable i haven’t find anything negative about them yet overall i give them a 55 rating im not blowing smoke up your bung but this game is the shizznit it brings a smile to my face just thinking about and should be mandatory for all patients in childrens hospitals this particular zelda game recalls the original legend of zelda in both style and gameplay this in my opinion makes it no less enjoyable for all ages okay i played the game a couple years ago so i decided to buy it for my son hes gotten old enough to enjoy it now solid gameplay and the item rental system is suprisingly not bad you have access to every item near the start of the game but you have to rent them from a mysterious visitor who has taken over your home after putting more rupees on it you actually get to keep the item otherwise you lose them upon death the reason why he chose your home is pretty cool but only revealed near the end its a pretty little sequel to the legend of zelda a link to the past definitely more than a remake or port and the golden kingdomdark world is now called lorule hehhyrule lorule with its own princess hilda how does anyone live there without being turned into an animal thats brilliant the ability to shift into walls as a painting is my only beef with the game right now as it eats the magic meter like candy cant wait to get the ½ magic use effectif thats a thing in this game i brought this game 3 months ago  its got great graphics  music im very happy with this game only thing is it so reminds me of a link to the past it is a good game the game is good but there is one part i didn’t like and that was that is was confusing in one part but that is because i’m stupid i would recommend the game to nintendo players this was a great game i played lttp and beat it and then i played this and beat it too as well i also like the new features with the new game i really enjoyed it   link to the past in my opinion is the greatest zelda game ever and this is a worthy follow up it’s a great game but it would cool if it was on the ps4 i got it with the matching 3ds xl earpieces are like soft silkyou could wear them for hours and not get a headache from the pressure around your ears many other headsets end up giving you and very long battery life as well as strong features they are made of soft flexible plastic that wont snap unlike turtle beaches and they self adjust to any head  this headset is lightweight and fits comfortably no leather means soft fabric is what you feel so you dont get that sticky sweaty leather\\r\\n\\r\\nthe wireless feature is very nice with very good range so long as you have an optical input for it originally bought one for xbox and loved it just got this one for ps4 unfortunately xbox and ps4 have different technology for wireless accessories so it’s not universal sound is great xbox version comes with code to unlock atmos sound most comfortable headset i’ve ever used true wireless with rechargeable battery mic is crystal clear  definitely recommend has everything you could need out of a headset from great sound to comfort ability bought this after a recommendation by a game stop employee have never been happier with a headset in my 15 years of online gaming execellent sound with an incredible sound cancelling mic and remarkable battery life extremely comfortable wore it today for roughly 10 hours straight bought this for my brother and he loves it long battery life great quality sound durable and comfortable first headset that i bought that never hurts my head at all very comfortable even after hours of competitive gaming great sound quality too very nice headset breathable over the ear cups are comfortable sound quality is very nice the microphone seems like it could extend longer closer to the front of the mouth sometimes i feel i need to talk with my mouth pointing to the side this is my second rig 800bought one for my xbox onewhen i bought my ps4 i bought a tb stealth 700 hated itfinally found a store with a rig 800 for ps4bought it love it as much as my other one i replaced my playstation wireless headset with this and i love it the sound is more clear and defined and you can hardly tell it’s on your head easy to install and perfect fit  durable great quality this game is basically a link to the past with the birds eye view style game play same map but takes place some time after lttp the 3d is amazing on this game the style of the characters reminds me of windwaker the story line is just as great as any of the zelda games this is one to add to the collection really cool mechanic to phase into walls but i felt that i never used some items in the game i never touched the boomerang because i never needed to i bought this mabye a month ago and i’ve loved the game it’s been a great experience brings back that old feel of zelda gives hours and hours of great fun yet challenging at the same time loved it i bought this a week ago and i am satisfied the 3d effects make it better like the picture is coming out i am happy with a game with different features to it made it interesting legend of zelda has been around for quite some time  i wish i enjoyed playing it more but i dont a twist on an old classic amazing to return to the hyrule of a link to the past played the heck out of it waaaaay better than skyward sword just saying enjoyed playing through  had it beat in 10 hrs of gameplay have to try heroic mode yet great game i’m a big fan of the zelda franchise never disappointed i have a lot of high end headsets astro a50 astro a40 tuttle beach 800 turtle beach 700 the list goes on but you get the point my husband got me the rig 800 for xbox as a gift i was really skeptical it looked funny and it wasnt 300 i didnt think it would compare to my other headsets my mind was blown so much so i had to buy its counterpart for the ps4 all my other expensive headsets now collect dust just buy it i bought this head set a couple weeks ago and man it is wonderfulso comfy too i forget im wearing it at times they did not give me anything i thought was worth the 150 buck price tag i have 40 dollar ones i thought were better very comfortable and great sound best purchase i have made in a very long time well worth every penny i bought this headset after my old one that was a different brand stopped working it is a really great headset excellent sound quality and amazing battery life well worth the money for sure i bought these about a month ago and so far charge times and battery life are excellent i did just charge for a few hours and said “medium” which i don’t understand how it didn’t get a full charge but maybe i’ll throw them back on there and see what happens  i also love the way the headband sits on the top of the head  if you live with people and you walk out to get something to drink they prob will say something because they are big but honestly i think the build is perfect the material used for the headphones themselves feels like it will last a long time i’m also a dj and my headphones have a weak vinyl material and they look old and beat up now  i would recommend these to a lot of people so far  i bought these last month and i’m very happy i chose these great inhancement for my games an just in time for black ops 4 really great headset works wonders for when my wife is asleep and i dont bug her with the noise coming from playing or watching videos really great buy definitely worth the price because ive had other cheaper headsets that did not work and last too long mic worked great comfortable earpieces and i could hear perfectly bought this as a christmas gift for a person who loves puzzles  they loved it this one was so interesting to complete the trick is to find the pairs  looks lovely on my coffee table this game uses the 3d features better than any other ds title the open world both hyrule and lorule is amazing and immersive and a decent challenge too my son loved this zelda version by recommendation of gamestop staff i love this game i pass the time playing this and i like that there are small hints throughout the story brings back pleasant memories of a link to the past along with new characters and changes this would be a fan fave for young and old alike if youre a zelda fan i have played many zelda games ever since the first came out for the nes the graphics the mobility and the long playability make me a great fan of this title highly recommended waited years to play it and now i finally have it the pay for an item system is great and its so nice to be back in the lttp world if you likedloved a link to the past as i did youre going to love a link between worlds more same classic loz game play with better graphics  loads more to figure out and do i love this game  am very happy we purchased it brings back so many good memories of lttp but makes plenty of new ones i love the nostalgia this game gives but also that it gives you a unique experience with a map of link to the past if your a zelda fan you have got to pick this one up after playing for only a couple of minutes i thought this game was just a cheap rerelease of link to the past after getting deeper into the game i realized how deep this game actually went i loved the new play mechanics and the graphical style it was a pleasure to see how much playing time was involved\\r\\n\\r\\ngreat game highly recommend these headphones are amazing  i have had them for a month and still never have had to charge them they have theater quality sound for a low price  highly recommend im very happy that i bought the rig 800 a week ago they are light and the sound is great and they fit my needs i love this new headset \\r\\nthe sound quality is excellent and they are so comfortable and light weight\\r\\na sound great so far my only complaint is i wish it would drown out the outside noise a little more but that is me being petty got on sale for 99 and am very pleased with them the sound on these headsets is so awesome on the xbox with dolby atmos you can hear a pin drop alsowith getting 4000 dollars off these headsets it was a great buy at just 9900 dollars and they were easy to set up great headset for the ps4 good quality and many options buy ir i purchased this headset about a week ago can walk all around my house and talk on it long lasting battery life great sounds and quality super light in your head comfort for long hours overall i am happy with this headset i purchased this headset because i broke the dongle to my wireless playstation platinum headset \\r\\n\\r\\ncomfort\\r\\nthe plantronics headset is far more comfortable than the playstation headset it doesn’t even feel like i’m wearing them playstation platinum headset was too tight and would give me headaches because i have glasses \\r\\n\\r\\nfeatures\\r\\nthe microphone and speakers on both pairs were fair and about the same however then playstation platinum had better features that allows users to prioritize gamechat volume plantronics has a similar feature but it only changes the game volume and leaves the chat volume at the same level \\r\\n\\r\\nbattery\\r\\nwhen it comes to battery power the plantronics is far better i at times play for up to 7 hours straight on a single charge and i’ve gotten zero low battery notifications from the plantronics whereas the playstation platinum will last me around 6 hours the first game i ever played was the legend of zelda a link to the past  when link between worlds was announced i was super hyped  now that ive played it albeit a bit late im hooked  theres so much random stuff to do and find  it was so good i finished the game in a single weekend if you love games from the legend of zelda franchise this one will not disappoint you while it does feel been there done that in parts its still a lot of fun and the callbacks to a link to the past are really sweet in addition it is very cool to have access to some of the triedandtrue classic tools and subweapons of games past such as the boomerang hammer bombs and the awesome ice rod i was also surprised to find that it is a little easier in difficulty than i would expect at least so far im on my sixth sage painting dungeon overall this game is definitely another great chapter in the storied game series a link to the past is probably my favorite game this brought back much of the nostalgia while bringing in new features got this a little bit ago to increase my 3ds game count and glad i did\\r\\ni usually complete a dungeon or two when i get the chance but each dungeon feels rewarding enough to complete will say controls feel slightly off at times but still controls pretty well  \\r\\n\\r\\nplot seems pretty simple but then again thats what i love about nintendo games at times one of the best zelda games ever made very underrated this game is full of challenging puzzles and reminds me of the original zelda games i highly recommend this game to anyone who is new to zelda or just a fan of the original games i have always loved zelda more than any other game and i was so excited to get this game when i finally got it i discovered that it was completely targeted towards kids and the dungeons were way to easy there were so many times i just wanted to smack ravio with my sword that looked like plastic not to mention links hair looks completely weird and nothing is nearly as good as i hoped it would be if you are looking at buying this game dont it will be a waste of your money this is the best zelda game made since 2006 i loved twilight princess but this game blew me away i instantly fell in love with this iteration of hyrule and all its characters the controls are very responsive and the music is incredible as always of course you have the regular guys like link zelda and ganon but this game introduces three new important characters hilda yuga and ravio all three play important roles in the epic story also this game is both a sequel and a remake of a link to the past one of the major things that sets this zelda apart from all the others is that items are not found in dungeons you rent buy items from ravio the instant i beat this game i made another file and played again the legend of zelda a link between worlds is one of the best looking games on the 3ds and is a must buy for any 3ds owner instantly reminded me of one of my favorites a link to the past for those already into loz series or just wanting to begin playing these it is a great game highly recommend  give it a try you wont regret it so im a massive zelda fan ive played all but three games the first two i dont have an nes and skyward sword i refuse to buy a wii a link between worlds is only out ranked by wind waker ocarina of time and maybe minish cap or majoras mask i absolutely love the game it is absolutely beautiful to look at the sound track is amazing the gameplay feels like the minish cap and i believe it will or at least should become a classic however its not all good there are two mechanics that i find interesting first is the wall merge this is a cool little mechanic that allows you to merge into a wall for a short time its not that i dont like this mechanic but its integrated into a ton of puzzles and i have a tendency to forget about the more gimmicky mechanics like this which causes me to get stuck even on my third play through second is that you rent most of you items now this one really sucks when you die you lose all of those items but that is not the reason i hate this mechanic the reason i hate this mechanic is that you never know just exactly what youre going to need in a dungeon if it werent for this mechanic link between worlds would easily be my favorite game of all time it is awful and should never be put into another zelda game bought these for my son to play fortnite on the nintendo switch with his friends bluetooth worked flawlessly with the switch only downside is you can only use it while playing docked as the bluetooth sensor hooks up to the usb port on the dock i’m very impressed with this headset i paid a lot but it’s worth the money i couldn’t be more happier thanks for gamestop i’m durant oklahoma for pointing them out to me its really lightweight durable comfortable and compact\\r\\nthe sound quality is fantastic and the mic comes in clear as a bell\\r\\nhavent had to charge it for almost a week and charges quickly when it needs to\\r\\ndefinitely looking forward to getting a lot of game time out of it i just got them and the way it sounds is great  i hear everything i can walk around the house and still talk on them i us them in the division and believe me i didnt know i can hear so many things thank you again i bought this a month ago and i’m so glad i did because it keeps my brother from bothering me amazing headset best one i ever owned worth every penny sound quality is amazing it captures specific sounds so good like main story cars or people or specific details i bought this headset looking for something but it’s actually really nice and perfect for any game good quality and an amazing mic go a long way in gaming i bought this like months ago and they are fantastic especially in fortnite whenever stuff get serious you can hear the enemys footsteps great headphones but really disappointed in the base distortion when there was to many explosions and gunfire during a game in my opinion his is one of the coolest games of the legend of zelda series considering how many games there are thats saying something its not too easy but its not impossible the effect of being able to merge into walls is incorporated immensely which i think makes the game all the better the duration of the game isnt too lengthy however i cant really give you a good estimate on that since i bingeplayed for a couple of days anyway i think this game is worth the buy the legend of zelda a link between worlds embodies everything that the zelda franchise is and should be in its purest form i would call this the definitive zelda game and the one that any fan of the franchise absolutely must play if they want to maintain any level of credibility\\n\\nzelda before all else is a game about exploration and puzzles delving into caves and dungeons is the vision miyamoto had when creating the first one and has been the games signature modus operandi for the last 27 years albw is that in its purest form unlike almost all previous zelda games this one offers you almost absolute freedom to you as far as your adventures direction aside for the sand rod only being obtainable after you finish a certain dungeon you are presented with all of hyrules dungeons at once ready for your spirit of adventure to explore at any point in time\\n\\nwhile the story does suffer slightly for this with no smooth progression throughout gamers that dont absolutely require a constant narrative wont be put off by this fact the underlying plot remains with you rescuingretrieving several artifacts of plot progression 1 true to zelda style upon whose collection the story progresses accordingly there is unfortunately very very little character development of any sort perhaps the single notable case being ravio while i am a sucker for characterdriven gameplay this game doesnt style itself as a characterdriven game and as such cannot be faulted for this\\n\\nthe second distinctive feature of zelda gameplay is puzzles and this is where albw bursts forth outshining the rising sun and bestowing cinnamon tans upon gamers the world over the puzzles in this game are easily the best that any legend of zelda game has seen ever the games core mechanic of turning into an image on a wall comes into use in every dungeon and many places in the overworld sometimes it is used in obvious ways and in others in such brilliant ways that even though the game clearly requires the player to use them one just cant help but pat themselves on the back because it is just that satisfying\\n\\nmake no mistake a link between worlds makes you feel smart the ultimate puzzle master the likes of which professor layton would bow to the games numerous puzzlesolving items come in handy in a wide variety of ways and are of a rather wide variety themselves the devs showed some real creativity with some of them while others are simply iconic to the legend of zelda series such as the hookshot and bombs\\n\\nbut this leads me to one of the games few shortcomings the boomerang simply put the thing is useless everything it can do the hookshot can do better and there is a grand total of one puzzle in the game in an option minidungeon that leads to a stack of rupees specifically in which only the boomerang and not the hookshot will work truth be told i think the boomerang was only put into the game because of how iconic it is and that irks me\\n\\nother lackluster items would be the sand rod and gust stick or whatever it was called the two are extremely situational but both have positive traits to outweigh their obsolescence the sand rod for one makes for some incredible strategies while utterly useless in combat and basically anywhere outside of the desert the sand rods function and its ability to work in tandem with links imaging power made the desert temple hands down the most interesting fun and fulfilling dungeon in the game sadly the rod is of no use whatsoever after that aside for retrieving one maiamai in the village after the boomerang i say this should be the last item you upgrade\\n\\nthe gust stick while bordering on useless as a puzzle item is one of the best items in combat once upgraded when empowered by the mother maiamai it stuns anything within its now greater range and i was surprised to find it probably the most useful weapon in the gauntlet on top of the mountain\\n\\nothers often cite ravios lending and selling items as one of the games faults but when you set aside the frustration you have to admit the system is brilliant its a punishment for death so that its not just a slap on the hand gives you a reason to save and economize those rupees you save up\\n\\ni cant emphasize enough just how fantastic a zelda game this is the only person i would not recommend this to would be one who only likes character and narrativedriven games  keep in mind i am just starting to get into gaming again but i thought that this game would be different i was expecting more of a fastpaced action game not necessarily a puzzle game with a little bit of action nonetheless i love it i understand the hype about the zelda games now it was challenging at first since i am not used to the format of the zelda games but the farther i get into it the better it becomes anyone of any age will love this game seriously go for it this game is great and has a wonderful story to follow you travel between hyrule and the newly discovered kingdom lorule while it saddened me to learn that zelda link between worlds wouldnt be developed in the 3d perspective like its modern counterparts i wasnt about to pass up a new zelda game this game utilizes the topdown perspective in ways i couldve never thought possible and the 3d is particularly stunning in this form the mechanics of being able to merge into walls is a blast and temporarily renders the perspective to something of 3d as i mentioned earlier not to be confused with the 3d effects of the system itself ill admit this game is not as challenging as many past titles but regardless it is a fun ride with enough references to a link to the past to make any zelda veteran feel right at home the open world concept gives a broader sense of freedom and exploration which i love my only complaint is the inability to connect across wifi for shadow battles streetpass is a cool feature but ill never understand why it seems to take priority over online features but regardless this zelda title is a joy to play and worth your time just amazing everything is perfect if you are a fan of the series just buy the game now and stop reading fans of a link to the past this is a love letter to us all one of the best games in the entire series is reinvented and its absolutely stunning graphics music controls the 3d the innovations are all 1010 buy now acting as a sequel to the legend of zelda a link to the past a link between worlds presents itself as a great game for fans of the series the plot for the game will keep you captivated throughout with the final scene leading to the battle with the final boss presenting a huge plot twist the 3d feature adds a lot to the game as players visit hyrule and lorule in 3d and merge in and out of painting form in 3d while there arent many items in the game the ones offered are some of the my personal favorite like the fire rod and the tornado rod all in all this game is one of my favorite zelda games the dungeons were masterfully done as usual the 3d made the game so much better and the plot was one of my personal favorites in the franchise its basically a link to the past but in 3d it is rather short only being 7 hours if you know what youre doing but if you try to get 100  getting all the miamis 20 hearts gold master sword it adds onto the story my favorite part was the master sword maze it is confusing because you get stuck almost everytime sometimes causing you to use play coins to find your way but pulling out the master sword was fantastic great game and a fun revision of lttp i really enjoyed my time with it but didnt really feel drawn to play it again after finishing any zelda fan would be crazy to pass it up what can i say it isnt what i was expecting im an extreme legend of zelda fan and im used to them having puzzles and challenges im used to spending ages in a dungeon trying to figure it out im used to fighting tricky bosses so far this game has none of that the dungeons are frustratingly easy i finish them in half an hour i havent gotten stumped once and the bosses have no chance against me fairy why would i need a fairy i can kill a boss and barely be damaged actually i beat a boss yesterday without losing hearts i like the new power this game brings and i like the music but thats about all i can say about it i dont like the idea of renting items either because then what satisfaction do you have in solving a dungeon im used to beating a dungeon and then being excited because now i can go do some side mission with my new item not anymore one more thing whats this about having unlimited arrows and bombs all i have a hope of getting from any chest or person is gold or a heart piece i miss finally beating that minigame and getting a bigger quiver how fun it was sighs i feel as if this game is geared towards children and im like i said disappointed please give me a legend of zelda game like twilight princess skyward sword spirit tracks ocarina of time etc dont make the games easier i beg of you only issue is the directions are not really helpful i just muddled through it and figured out how to make the mic work its not hard head set feels nice on my ears too terribly awesome is more like it completely wireless light excellent battery life easy installation and great sound quality i am quite satisfied with them and i’m sure you will be too d they were terrible i could barley hear the game volume chat worked great i have big ears and all other headphones start to irritate them after a few hours i can wear these pretty much all day and they are still comfortable i also have a pair of the 800lx for my xbox one great headset only downside would be can’t use as regular headphones for music they had great sound quality however all the features didn’t work so i traded them for the sony platinum which are amazing and everything works highly recommend this headset makes gaming a better experience most comfortable headset i’ve ever had fantastic sound and mic holy buckets batman i love that ive upgraded it looks cool its sturdy and put together with precision i was happy with them until the mic randomly stopped working within the first month i picked this up so i could add another shooter to my game collection and im glad i did  the game involves shooting tons of robotic alien invaders and crafting your own weapons which have varying firepower and abilities if you enjoy a nontime invested type shoot em up game then youll love motghergunship youll have a blast from the sheer firepower of the \\r\\nweapons that you create it is kind of fun have only played it a little but have had fun while playing it absolutely garbage looks and feels like a playstation 2 game a 3d arena bullet he11 game where you have complete control over your weapons and their combinations the game was a bit too light on campaign content at launch but have since added a major update with more missions for the campaign and coop to boot the game is a steal at the current price and while the difficulty ramps up a bit too fast for some people and the roguelike elements annoy a bit it more than makes up for its faults with incredibly fun and hectic gameplay oh and the writing is snappy and entertaining this game is broken weak campaign confusing weapon system basic level design just a bad game all around not fun at all i traded it in the same day i bought it great crafting mechanic makes every experience feel incredibly special something you can spend hours playing would be a 5 but it’s almost the exact same game as ‘tower of guns’ graphics are block rendered good game if you can get it for 1520 my husband bought me this mystery box because im a huge need and i love grab bags granted im not a fan of every fandom that was thrown in there there was a great variety plus you definitely get more than you paid for my husband bought me this mystery box because im a huge need and i love grab bags granted im not a fan of every fandom that was thrown in there there was a great variety plus you definitely get more than you paid for these are a great set of headphones setup was a little tricky as it came with an audio cable as well as a usb cable but i have the new ps4 without an audio output but that was not addressed in the paperwork i had to research it on the net to figure out that you just dont use that cable with the slim \\r\\nonce hooked up the sound is great the mute feature when you raise the mic is great \\r\\noverall i am very happy with this headset some headphones seam heavy and squeeze your ears these do not light and comfortable they are super easy to connect and the sound is exceptional worth the extra money just bought a second pair one for xbox and one for playstation i’m no noob to high end headphones and these are by far the best sounding you can get and seem to be only limited by the production value of the game or the sound stage of the consoles in the game this is a childrens comedy game if you are expecting something like a regular zelda game dont get it the game is very fun and if you can handle the 3d for a little its worth turning it on just to look around it is a top down style game and reminds me of the pokemon x camera angles overall its an awesome game and if youre a fan of the zelda series and have a 3ds you gotta get it i have never played a link game before i bought this game to play on a trip and i couldnt stop playing it it was great everything was good and it is probably the best game i have ever played the legend of zelda series has few games that should not be owned and pretty much none by hardcore loz fan this is no different this game was truly epic and came with everything i wanted in a loz game the gameplay is fun and very easy to pick up sound is great with epic music and such animation is great with a classical feel to it the storyline at first was kind of throwing me off a bit but once you get deeper into it itll not only hold your attention but make you want to keep playing my biggest struggle was to remember i could paste myself to a wall to get around and avoid enemies this is because im used to having to fightroll away or something being able to go into the wall creates a whole new style of playing and is a greateasy addition while some parts might be frustrating just keep in mind it is loz and there is always a way to solve the puzzles this was my first zelda game i recently just beat it and i am stunned this game is absolutely amazing the graphics are amazing for a 3ds game the only thing i have a problem with is link he looks a lot different the sound is really good not as good as other zelda titles but still great the gameplay is spectacular nothing wrong with that this game took me months to beat because there are so many different minigames and dungeons the last thing is this is a problem in a lot of zelda games is that after you buy all the items from ravio youre just racking up on rupees for instance when i beat the game i had 7500 rupees but i guess its okay im still fairly new to my 3ds and at first i was skeptical about getting this game from watching the youtube trailers on it but however i decided i would get it used and try it from gamestop since its such a big title im glad i got it so far and ive only beaten the first boss level for me the game is challenging because once again im new to the 3ds and gaming but its lots of fun you can morph through walls to move along in the game  pretty cool if you ask me  and the graphics are pretty amazing though i’ve only thoroughly played and beaten two zelda games i am confident a link between worlds will be remembered as a high point in the series the game’s oldschool zelda style is significantly different from that of more modern titles and it’s a truly triumphant return the item collection aspect is surprisingly fun helping to bolster the game’s somewhat weak poststory more on that later perhaps the quest to obtain every last tool weapon and heart piece is so addictive because most if not all of the collectibles will contribute to your combat skills and therefore each directly affects regular gameplay this improvement of fighting capability is made sweeter by the streetpass shadow link battles which let the player battle ai representations of other people’s characters complete with individual items and equipment this feature too helps make the game last longer though i wish there was a way to directly do battle with others\\n\\nthe game’s graphics are good and the use of the 3d effect is exemplary it legitimately contributes to some parts’ visual quality the soundtrack and sound effects are both great also of particular quality are the overworld themes of both hyrule and lorule the story is good and the characterization of ravio princess hilda and yuga is nicely executed for a video game the optional order of dungeon completion in lorule was a nice addition too the combat system is simple yet effective and though some lorulean enemies are a bit overpowered this should be mitigated by eventual health and weapon upgrades and though some specific instances in the game felt a bit obscure as to how to progress this can probably be attributed to my inaptitude at zelda games rest assured enough experimentation and exploration can generally solve most puzzles and problems\\n\\nthe only real place wherein a link between worlds falters is in lasting appeal though the aforementioned item collection is fun the game could have used a better poststory and by better poststory i mean a post story there is none after beating the final boss you’re reset to right before the showdown this is very annoying to me generating a perpetual feeling of incompleteness even after the player has collected every last item i understand that the way in which the story ends somewhat prevents a playable poststory but i’m still disappointed and though the streetpass functionality is fun and the challenge of scoring best times at the treacherous tower is an option it’s hard to dedicate much time to perfecting myself in those minigames this is because at its core zelda isn’t really a game that’s meant to be a competitive “sharewithyourfriends”type experience and the second quest isn’t very enticing either with too little changed aspects to make it worth it still a link between worlds is an awesome game and i would definitely recommend it if you’re a fan of the adventure genre this game is awesome if you liked the old legend of zelda games this new one takes the cake with a pretty cheesy but neat new mechanic of turning into a painting the graphics were jagged and i dislike that but it didnt take away from the experience and you can kind of expect that with the 3ds screen resolution so i wont beat on it all said this is an addictive and fun game that can test your wits at some points and is definitely worth it to tell you the truth the first loz game i beat not played was ocarina of time than majoras mask being used to that style of gameplay made me hesitant on getting this game with the bird eyes view style like the older games all that waiting was in vein because this game was fantastic between the storyline gameplay graphics music and more the game accomplished everything and more in a zelda game honestly there isnt much to say without spoiling the game but id recommend this game to most people especially legend of zelda fans because it not only has the rpgfighting but has a huge variety of puzzles that make you love the game all zelda games possess a certain magic about them they are fun and also boring at other times and they are very difficult i admit i needed a walkthrough for some parts of the game but i was still fun it was short so that sucked but it was nice its a zelda game what is not to love aside from some confusing and difficult parts if you want to have your mind really challenged this is a great game if you like rpgs get this game you know what just go buy it and enjoy it really enjoyed all three of these games the storyline is great the graphics are great it is amazing to be able to play these games again especially heavy rain and beyond i am so beyond thrilled i cant put my controller down my son wanted detroit becomes human for a long time and this came with 2 bonus games he loves alot gameplay was short but many different outcomes to make things very interesting three incredible games for such an amazing price considering they are all around 30 bucks individually made my first purchase at gamestop the box of the collection has some obvious tears and it looks like it is preowned i’m very disappointed as i wanted to keep it as a collection that’s also why i chose to buy a new one instead of a preowned tried emailing the company but didn’t get any reply if you are looking for a story game this is it not much action but the storybis good really enjoying the story lines and the two player game is definitely a surprise what a great buy non stop fun and several different story outcomes fantastic bundle each game entertaining in their own way i thoroughly enjoyed playing them and recommend them to anyone looking for well executed interactive storytelling games from the oldest game heavy rain which was hilarious and endearing to detroit become human which was a blast playing multiple playthroughs to find out how our choices resulted in vastly different timelines these games are a worthwhile grab also really appreciate the extras and behind the scenes so much went into making these games too its great  its quantic dream sis its awesome follow me on twitch knightpeachii never doubt nintendo they always manage to exceed in giving us games we want especially in franchises such as zelda and mario link between worlds is an absolutely amazing game youre not going to want to put your 3ds down the story to the game is incredible the graphics are beautiful and all in all its just one amazing game i highly recommend this game to nintendo lovers as well as anyone else who is thinking about joining the nintendo train this game is fun for you zelda fans but if you want longevity the story line is short i beat it in two days the new merge mechanic is nice but at times i was confused at what to do a good example is the dungeon turtle rock the ending was nice overall a great game but the puzzles in the dungeons could be toned down a link between worlds is an instant classic and it is going to be a huge influence for future gaming it had a perfect balance with retro gameplay and modern gameplay as well i love the creativity with the portrait effect the orchestrated music is so amazing i love how in every situation it would switch the soundtrack constantly there are lots of enjoyable mini games with nice rewards at the end of course you can enjoy the adventure throughout the lightdark world in 3d im glad that they took advantage with the 3d because its like a cherry on top of a magnificent sundae now the only complain i have is that game isnt as challenging or as difficult as other zelda games i didnt feel the urgency or the edge of the seat situation like i had with a link to the past or ocarina of time especially on dungeons and boss battles but yet again that is why they added hero mode just for hardcore gamers like myself to make a long story short its a must buy\\n\\n1010 the legend of zelda a link between worlds is one of my fav games ever made the graphics are very good with rich lighting and beatiful colors in the first few seconds of gameplay you will see a bird flying over the large game world form right outside your house in the game the game might have a top down view but it is still looks great with live time lighting and amazing things to see very smooth animation with great uses of motion blur to make it feel so real the 3d adds a amazing pop between layers and turning in to a painting lts u see the simamatic view of the charecter models in 3d moving about as well as all the other objects around u from a different angle zelda is also a beautiful lady in this game i wish she was real such a nice lady to any way the sound effects are also great u can hear the birds you can hear your sword cutting throw the air and you can hear your own foot steps perficly in line as you walk or run throw the game world the game takes a different apporch no longer are all the key ideas found in the games brilantly designed dungons but they u can now buy them from a friendly if not greedy merchant or rent them how ever if u rent them and die he will take them back so this adds a punishment for death and makes u more teance the combat is smooth and almost all your ideas have effect in it the smooth animation and clashing of meadal sound effects as well as some well designed bosses and a adivtive streetpass shadow link duals make the combat surpisily enjoyible if not a bit sempictic and repetive compared to passed resent zelda games each chearacter in the game has a great personilty as a part of the story and the story is full of lour and gives amazing context for futher zelda games in the timeline like oot and majoras mask the story is meaningful and emotional at times it is inspirerd by some real world history and thouse who dig hard enogh will fine a amazing meaing in the games design both story and gameplay really make you feel like your own a adventure how ever the open world is great and broght to life in a all new way its the same basic lay out as a link to the pass this may bring back great memorys of one of 16 bit games finest express and it hold up today very well but the lake of changes to the hub world did seem a little strange as many of the parts of history they draw from comes from differet arrows of roamen history ect yet the over world is not roamen or really changed to fix the story it does not feel overly nastogic but its open world design is some what limmed my its roots that said the story blow my mind as did the amazing puzzles in the all new doungons some puzzles have different ways to sove them and are all amazingly design to give u the amazing feeling of soving a great zelda dougon and if u get stuck you can go see the fortion teller or buy hints with play coins for a ghosts the story and level design were so emotionaly powerful for me this game gets my full recomenation and 2013 game of the year buy it now and follow me on miiverse my nintendo net work id is 3dsflo also this game has chickens so thats awesome i purchased this game yesterday and it was totally worth the forty bucks ravio is great and the weapon renting system is also good it even has good field as well as dungeon combat i recommend it to all kinds of gamers i love all the new stuff that this game brings to the table i love how nintendo refreshes their games and this game is an example since 1986 zelda has been the game that revolutionized the way we look at games shigeru miyamoto has done it again this game has a clever use of the 3d ability of the 3ds or 2ds it was the first game i got for 3ds n its perfect for anyone in 14 years old and i dont care this is one of the greatest games of all time its one of those games that takes you so long to do something but when you finally do it you feel like nothing can stop you this is an intense action game that involves alot of paying attention to things people say to you in the game just go out and get it why are you still reading this go man go let me start by saying that i have never been into the zelda series i have tried playing other games in the series and they have never held my attention for long after watching some videos i figured to give this one a try i am really glad i did i really enjoyed playing this game the graphics are great and the story is awesome this was the only game i played for 2 weeks this newest addition to the zelda series had captured my attention and i looked forward to the next time i would play if you have never played or cared for the zelda series give this one a try i am a huge zelda fan and have played most of the games and i must rave about how excellent this game was it had great puzzles and was incredibly fun it also had my favorite story line next to twilight princess overall this was a wonderful game and i would recommend it to anyone i first had doubts about the game but after getting it for christmas and playing it i couldnt put my 3ds down the graphics were amazing though i wish they used the 3d more and the gameplay was a perfect challenge  i recommend this game to everybody its great for someone who likes a challange quantic dream never disappoints with their titles also action packed with decision making and so many different outcomes for your story highly recommend this box set is the best it has the 3 best games of its respective years they all look amazing and the play style is extremely smooth the game detroit is the best game yet it has so much replays lott and i love that i played detroit becomes human and it was good i liked the story line the interactive film is what i love is like to live other life i love the environment and cine the reality of the graphics is the best of the game for me is gold while quantic dreams games are a bit of a mess i have a lot of fun playing them detroit is easily the best game of the three but its nice to be able to play the other two on the newest console id say its worth it for the price detroit becoming human was amazing the other two ugh beyond wasnt bad but not good heavy rain sucked its one good collection it has almost everything you could ask for in a collection except all the addons i would recommend it to my friends living in michigan i just had to have the game detroit all games in this 3 pack are exceptional like that you can play them more than once and have different outcomes enjoyed detroit immensley hard rain found controls annoying as they didnt always work the first or tenth time have not yet played beyond this game bundle was the reason i bought a ps4 the quantic dream collection is worth the buy but it will require hours of work and a lot of patience the only game i did not thoroughly enjoy was heavy rain the mechanics were odd and it was harder to play otherwise i would recommend it not gamestop’s fault but least favorite figure so far i love batman beyond this figure is well made and looks amazing besides batman my gamestop has great people and a great selection ok legend of zelda series is a great one but this one is one of the better ones it is very difficult to figure out sometimes so i admit i used walkthroughs so one bad thing for the game but it is a long campaign so that is a big plus took me two weeks at 5 hours a day two complete great game very confusing at times and the end is a bit twisted even i was surprised great for kids and adults im not going to post some huge review but i had to get on here and gush over this game a bit im a long time fan of the zelda series and have played every one to date  even the target shooter for the wii excluding wind waker hd as i dont own a wii u yet and i have to say this is the most fun ive had with the series since oot if youve been on the fence about getting a 3ds this is the reason to buy if your a fan of the series you cant afford to pass this one up having played a link to the past a link between worlds was chock full of nostalgia for me the over world map the music the art style it all hearkens back to the snes classic the gameplay is fun and the ability to start with most of the items sets it apart from previous titles the ability to enjoy open exploration is a welcome change from its spiritual predecessor and i enjoy seeing where i can go using the tools at hand before even going into dungeons this is an awesome game i love how the music fits and very enjoyable this is one of the best zelda games ever created the morphing into the stone and being apart it it just adds another affect witch makes it more challenging the bosses very created bosses but also can be hard to fight the story is great it flows pretty good and a surprising ending that made me go shock the game makes it more freely play then a straight path like in every zelda game they choose where you go but in this game you can go to any dungeon all you have to do is go buy items from the guy who is renting your house in the beginning anyway if your still asking yourself should i bye this game i would say yes this is one of the best zelda games ever it takes a special kind of game to make me like that genre and i like that genre i would give it a rating just above portal which would be a 9710 the gameplay is fantastic the graphics are okay with about the level of a late gamecubeearly wii game however graphics never sold me a game the real thing that sells me any legend of zelda title is the exploration and puzzle solving the amount of exploration and nonlinearity that is contained within this game is perfect i have never played a game that did exploration better the only possible downside is that there is no challenge in finding rupees wherever you go there shall be rupees but it is still a great game this is the best handheld game ive ever played amazing story amazing experience pick it up like the other reviews around the web say 1010 a game with great gameplay story and characters the graphics arent the best but thats because of the hardware more or less this game gives hours of fun its defiantly worth picking it up this game has completely exceeded my expectations i expected it to be a cheap remake of a link to the past but it wasnt even close to that its more its better its justtheres no words its just so amazing  if you are a zelda fan this game is a must you literally cant be a zelda fan and not have this game believe me youll love it d what can i say ive always loved tloz games and this one is not an exception\\nthe story is really entertaining and well scripted the graphics cartoontype but who cares about that anyway the music right from tloz orchestra beautiful\\nthis is the type of videogame that gets me right in front of the 3ds screen for hours not only to figure out what to do in the dungeons but also to explore the nostalgic hyrule and its new secrets and of course the new lorule with all its crazy inhabitants\\nanother thing i also liked from this game is the fact that is not linear at all i mean in other zelda games you have to go from an specific dungeon to another specific dungeon but in this one you can go in the order you want its a small but very notable change at least for me\\nif i had to take a favorite character from this game just this game its would probably be ravio not because is spoiler links counterpart spoiler but because hes some funny looking and acting guy and that ravios shop was also a new and kinda frustrating thing fighting enemies all day for some cash woo\\nalso he talks nuff said\\na great game for everyone definitely worth playing i love legend of zelda to the point where i have associated comic books tattoos etc so i was all excited to play this game i beat the whole thing in less than a week of mostly casual play my job had kept me pretty busy that week so i had mostly only been able to play during lunch breaks and such i also was not a big fan of the weapon rentals while i liked the ravio character the game kind of lost something to me when i could walk around with nearly every weapon after only the second or third dungeon and it takes away some from the dungeons sense of accomplishment when youre not finding and discovering the items in each dungeon beyond that yeah the graphics were nifty and storyline was good the wall merging was an interesting new mechanic but overall it was just kind of a letdown havent played all of them yet but for the price it was outstanding extremely interactive multiple storylines and diverse characters it’s different everytime i play it what’s not to love about these games i love how you make up the story graphics and voice acting are well done as well great series for a great deal very narrative driven and you feel part of the action all your choices weight has with consequences and how the game progresses the games have great story even so the game mechanics pull away from the player’s enjoyment timed button combos do no justice to the games finally gamestop does not recognize the package upon return and will only take the games back individually action packed game hours of fun action around every corner when i bought the game for my son i asked the clerk specifically if there was cussing in the game and she said there was not however the game was full of inappropriate language actually overly bad and the sad part is it isn’t necessary the game isn’t bad actually exquisite im hook on this game the psychological gameplay is awesome one action creates a domino effect plus multiple storys and ending whats not to love loved all these cinematic games glad they remastered both heavy rain and beyond two souls this is definitely for a fan like myself a perfect collection and for a great dealprice the games speak for themselves as long as you dig story based games where you decide outcomes they are winners we love the finished product but it was a beast to put together definitely needed two people and the directions were hard to follow it also didn’t feel super sturdy at the end but once we wall mounted it felt more sturdy we’ll see if it ends up being worth the assembly time and cost this is a great functioning shelf it was quite time consuming to put together the backing is very hard to get in and there wasn’t any indications of that in the instructions this shelf is perfect for my kiddo the quality is great and stores a ton of stuff it was a bit challenging to put together myself and is heavy when finished but i managed i’m extremely pleased with the finished product it looks good but not great quality and came damage during shipment \\r\\nthe instructions for assembly have lots of room for improvement read each step carefully and look a step or two ahead to see where it is going it’s a beautiful piece of furniture in mi daughters bedroom she loved using the storage bins i bought the espresso previously i was very satisfied with the purchase and recommend this item if youre looking for a organizer i am so glad tat i purchased this toys storage for my little one it fits perfectly to my daughters room the quality is as expected only one thing that bothered me is the instruction that isnt that clear as i expected best product i have bought to organize my childrens toys bottom portion is perfect for larger items bins are great for dolls and smaller objects height makes it all accessible heavy rain and beyond two souls are the sakes games i remember but a little cleaning than i remember detroit become human is a phenomenal game definitely worth a play the three games together are more than worth the price great set of games well worth the price abd your time to play them to be honest i really enjoyed detroit become human and heavy rain in both of those titles you have different protagonists with their own storyline but each time into the overall story and each decision you make for the most part determines the outcome of their own ar to be honest i really enjoyed detroit become human and heavy rain in both of those titles you have different protagonists with their own storyline but each time into the overall story and each decision you make for the most part determines the outcome of their own arcs  while flawed  these two games are enjoyable and the results are mostly satisfying the characters evoke strong emotions and it makes some of the odd pacing of the games worth it  beyond two souls however is very confusing  the controls are awful the story is convoluted the characters are for the most part very unlikable  the first two games mentioned have an overall satisfying reward despite what ending you get and beyond to souls your endings are mostly the same you get to choose between two options a lot of your decisions don’t really matter this is the lesser title of the three that being said i think that heavy rain and detroit become human are both excellent quantic dream titles and therefore it’s worth it to get the collection just so you can play those two  and beyond your endings are mostly the same you get to choose between two options a lot of your decisions don’t really matter this is the lesser title of the three that being said i think that heavy rain and detroit are both excellent quantic dream titles and therefore it’s worth it to get the collection just so you can play those two ive the collection its awesome and very interesting really neat to play them from oldest to newest the last two are really good and the last one is awesome i would have given this five stars but when i played beyond two souls it crashed awesome value for 3 classic games i love this collection detroit and beyond spectacular heavy rain has low quality gameplay and voice acting other than heavy rain the pack was great great bundle of quantic dreams classic games only wish they had included all the dlc as well these are some of the best story nased games ever from the review title i haven’t played it yet but it does look super fun and i can’t wait to play it gamestop is always good to me the employees take time to listen to me and understand what i’m looking for i don’t shop anywhere else unless they don’t carry a game i’m looking for i’ll recommend gamestop to absolutely everybody good game would recommend always start games at the hardest difficulty so when you complete it you feel an immense amount of accomplishment probably why i don’t feel accomplished u should play it if u like single player games or coop best game ever challenging game play it will test your skills very tough boss fights but gets better as you upgrade your weapons a lot of great creatures and amazing landscapes very fun to play with a lot of cool items and weapons this is a fantastic game  we are having a blast playing the whole game together me and my family and friends we are doing campaign and survival mode \\r\\nif you are a dark souls fan this is a must have\\r\\nif you are not a dark souls fan this is still a must have the graphics game play and level design for remnant are a bit clunkydated if you are used to toptier releases but i was willing to ignore all that for the sake of a great story  the bits and pieces of information you can gather early in the game are really intriguing which made me eager to plow ahead  but after trying and failing the first boss fight 40 or 50 times its just not worth it  i tried the boss solo 1015 times and with two others another 30 times or so  never got more than about halfway  explosive enemies just pop up out of nowhere with virtually no warning every few minutes  i dont understand these games that think difficulty equals fun or good  its just absurd  considering how many games are available and fun it just wasnt worth it to keep pounding my head against the wall fun game weapon variety and boss variety different worlds definitely a must have constantly get kicked off unable to host or join can’t like a game if i can’t play it when they update i’ll take this review down to easy even when set to harder settings after playing for an hour really wanted a refund this game has been a wonderful time filler for the past month for me i didnt like how you had to rent items at first but you eventually are able to buy them i would 100 recommend this awesome game not as memorable as ocarina of time or skyward sword but a really excelent fun zelda game a definite play for all zelda fans this is the best game i ever play on my 3ds by far i thinks this is the best game great nintendo i really enjoy playing this game the best game for fans and for adventure gamers and the awsome new abblitis and fighting and tell your freinds this game is a little upsetting due to the controls not working right so i cant give this game anymore then a 7 if the controls worked better and easier it would a better game as a zelda fan ive been very excited for this to come out for about a year when nintendo was making a big deal over it when the day finally came i traded two games towards this i played it and i was having a good time five days after release i finished it i couldnt believe how easy it was for crying out loud nintendo first luigis mansion dark moon was too easy and short and now a zelda title where are the development masters from 1998 i honestly dont see why a bunch of people are rating it 10 out of 10 oh and did i mention that i beat it in less than 17 hours and i didnt use a strategy guide or any guide the only reason i havent gotten rid of it yet is because i want to try to finish the hero mode its very rageactivating but thats hero mode i think theres too many giveaways in the dungeons id say this is for kids 812 years old or so i am a huge legend of zelda fan i have played all the games and cant get enough of the series this game brings you back to the old top down zelda games its quite difficult and it really makes you think the new mechanics they introduced are great the story is awesome and the soundtrack is phenomenal just imagine all of your favorite zelda songs from the 90s early 2000s revamped with a full orchestra it is new and nostalgic at the same time you cant be considered a fan of the series unless you play this game it is one of my favorite games of this year and i love everything about it do not miss this game i played legend of zelda a link to the past when it came out for super nintendo and beat it at least 3 times and have very fond memories if your story is similar or if youre a fan of the zelda series get this game i have to say having played a link to the past has been making this game a lot of fun being very familiar and different at the same time if that makes any sense my only gripe is the renting system with items but im only about 8 hours into the game so maybe that changes later a link to the past was the one game that originally got me to be interested in the zelda series so naturally i had to pick up a link between worlds but what i wasnt expecting was that i would be so entranced by this game to the point that i would be playing this game for hours on end by far the best part about this game is its utilization of the 3d in such a beautiful way that it makes you wonder why arent all games in 3d on to game play i can see how the weapon rental system can get annoying but i never died in the game so it was never really a bother to me all of the dungeons are different from its snes counterpart as to keep you interested in finding a way out the games soundtrack is amazing there is so little bad things to say about this game but if i could say anything it would be two things due to the rental system combat is too easy you wont find that a boss has a specific weakness to a weapon usually just your sword works most of the time two also due to the rental system some of the dungeons seem less involved with the specific item needed to get to that dungeon if im going to have to go back to ravio to get a specific item im going to want to use that item to its fullest all in all this game is a must own for zelda fans and its at least a good decision for some regular gamers i have played most zelda games and it is definitely my favorite series that exists a link between worlds definitely does not disappoint it is a very cute squeal to a link to the past it has detailed game play and many new awesome features i thoroughly enjoyed it it is really fun but it feels like multiplayer is almost required for some bosses if you are familiar with dark souls or bloodborn you will enjoy this and add it to your collection gameplay smooth and graphics are nice i absolutely loved detroit which is why i bought the other two and they turned out to both be good as well not as good as detroit but still worth the buy i love it i like the fact that i can get one really well known game and two semi known games for a little bit cheaper than a normal aaa title they are really great games and i think it’s worth buying and playing beautiful gameplay with 2 excellent additions i enjoyed playing detroit the game started off slow but quickly picked up the pace i played on the casual level so that i could enjoy the storyline without a challenge if you’re a complete fan of the series you’ll love this collection these games are focused on story over gameplay if youre looking to have fun none of these 3 will satisfy that itch  \\nbut if you are looking for a good story or a nice movie these 3 can be one to pick up love quantic dream collection and all their games all games are great if you like story driven games this is an awesome collection of games for a really good price even if you’ve played heavy rain or beyond two souls when they were new on ps3 they are worth revisiting if you enjoyed them also while i have yet to finish detroit become human the few hours i have played have been enjoyable great game loved the storyline and had crazy tear jerkers would love more games like this kind of storyline 3 great games with crazy good stories you can play while others watch its that good of a story beyond to sounds and detroit eventually remove all the hud so it feels like an animated movie and heavy rain is just a classic intense story the fugure is sweet and has better articulation than the 1st version way better than the original release looks much more natural and better poseability it looks kind of shoddy in the picture but is absolutely gorgeous in person 1010 figure figure paint was a bit messed up but overal okay box was mint though before i started the game i thought it was just a visual upgrade from link to the past but when i started the game the puzzles where brand new the combat was smooth and the story was simple yet enticing one of my favorite zelda games yet shut up and take my money nintendo disclaimer i may have missed spelled a lot of things also probably alot of grammar errors overall gameplay i really enjoyed playing this game with the new mechanic to transform into a moving painting really added a lot of creative ways to go about and move around through a dungeon one thing i feel is the bosss were a tad bit easy but i didnt really mind it much solving the puzzles and getting through the dungeons using the new mechanic made up for it graphics in my opinion what really makes the game look good is the art style it really makes this game pop some people might dislike the art style i personally love it sound the music is what you could expect from a zelda game amazing and relaxing and just epic sound effects in the game are also very good lasting appeal i myself have played through the game once and still exploring finding many different things ive missed along my journey i also found myself testing out the streetpass battle system where you fight shadow link and earn rupees this wont really add any lasting appeal just sort of a fun and easy way of earning money if you can defeat him in the game there is also these dungeons where your goal is to get treasure by solving the puzzle im pretty positive theres no enemys in these types of so called dungeons the one mode that tops this off is hero mode which you unlock after you beat the game the difficulty of the game is heightened im now just starting my play through of it from what i know i dont think much is changed except the difficulty of mobs and bosses and i believe you take much more damage per hit well i probably left a lot out but anyways i enjoyed this game and i hope other people will to i guess ill conclude by saying happy holidays the legend of zelda a link between worlds is the greatest legend of zelda game ive ever played the new gameplay mechanics are a breath of fresh air in the zelda series the bosses and dungeons are fun and unforgettable also the streetpass feature is very fun a link between worlds has blown me away with its awesome new characters and style in gameplay the concepts and puzzling levels have me addicted to this game its truly a masterpiece and worth every penny highly recommend this game to any zelda fan this game pays homage to a link to the past in many ways almost like a direct sequel its new its sharp and enjoyable i was worried at first about the 2d3d system but its masterfully implemented and causes veteran fans of a link to the past to think in new ways sometimes it can be a bit easy but later in the game it becomes very challenging more than the challenge its unbelievably fun i consider alttp to the best loz game out there and this one doesnt disappoint i honestly had my doubts on this on been playing zelda since 1992 and this one will be a classic i got this game yesterday and it was and is awsome   i immediatley started playing and got pretty far so it seems to go pretty fast wich is not my favorite type of game but this game still rocks first off its a sequel to my favorite zelda game so it has a lot to live up to i think this game is fantastic creative puzzles fantastic music tough boss battles and the visuals are a great melding of old and newschool zelda art styles if you remember link to the past running around hyrule will send you on a great nostalgia trip the item renting system initially bothered me but i grew to enjoy it as it allows you to complete the dungeons in any order you see fit you can buy the weapons you rent for about 800 rupees some for a little more but you find money stashed in so many different places that this isnt a problem there is even a cool upgrade system for the weapons and gear you accumulate give the game a chance before you complain about the changes made to the standard zelda formula as many are doing i really think any real fan of the series will enjoy this game as well as anyone who appreciates a well put together action adventure game thats right this game is gold people need to stop complaining that the game is too easy or the dungeons are to easy why dont people actually pay attention to the game play the game has a unique and breathtaking experience you can go in walls and walk while you are in one to help you get places in the dungeons you need to merge into the walls and go to another corner to get to a platform to get to some stairs that were out of reach before there are also new weapons such as\\n the sand rod\\n the tornado rod\\n the ice rod\\nand the fire rod\\nthe music is stunning in a good way it is done by a different composer than previous zelda games but thankfully they picked a good one the lasting appeal takes so long before it goes away a lot of people have been saying this game is worse than previous zelda games that things have changed but in my opinion video games cant always be the same thing over and over again and that it is good to change thats something that a lot of gamers dont get these days sometimes video games need to be worth their color gold the legend of zelda a link between worlds is none other than a beautiful experience that every gamer must play here are 10 reasons why you must have this game 1 music the soundtrack in this game is absolutely gorgeous from epic tracks to soft tracks this is one of the best sounding zelda games 2 the characters in all zelda games the characters you meet along your journey are always memorable and this game is no exception from the evil and sure of himself villain to the princess of the dark kingdom of lorule all the way to the weird yet awesome shop keeper you will find yourself truly connecting with the characters of this game in every sense 3 the story though not deep enough to make you cry the story throughout the game is fantastic and perfectly well paced 4 freedom in exploration over the years zelda games have become very strict in the sense that you go to this dungeon an then that dungeon in this new adventure you decide where you want to explore in any order you want this brings me to the next reason 5 new way to play in this adventure instead of you getting key items in dungeons youll be able to get all of them for a high price soon after you begin your quest this allows you to explore the land and solving puzzles at any time you would like to 6 the action like all zeldas you are link with you sword shield and other weapons this game is no exception with its spot on gameplay thats as fun as heck to beat the enemies with 7 wall morningor whatever its called in this installment youll be able to ride along side the walls to get to places you never could in order to solve puzzles and find items this adds a tremendous amount of new fun experiences to the game that i never felt before in any zelda title this new ability is truly unique 8 the puzzles with every dungeonthere must be puzzles to keep you from moving forward and this game has some of the best ive solved in a long time using your items smarts and new wall morphing ability this game is packed with really fun clever and only some difficult puzzle solving 9 i dont have a number 9 so lets move on to number 10 10 zelda let me remind you this is a legend of zelda titlewhy wouldnt you buy it okay now to the final question you read this whole review to get an answer to which is should you but this game and is it worth buying a 3ds for the simple answer would be yes the complicated answer would be every reason you read throughout this review i thought the games were really cool i already completed beyond two soul and heavy rain and the games are so cool thank you so much for your help and i will be in for rage and the new controller and i know you wont disappoint i tried all 3 games my favorite is become human of course with second game being beyond two souls and then heavy rain its a fantastic game really great detail glad i bought the quantic dream collection only played detroit so far but it is a great game engaging story game for the ages it will always be a favorite a little repetitive but very smooth game play interesting concepts great story games fun taking turns playing characters with your friends at your side fantastic set of games played heavy rain before but never the other 2  loved detroit  cannot wait to play beyond but i want to replay heavy rain quantum dreams is the reason i bought a ps3 pcxbox fan i am super glad i have a ps4  emmersive single player narratives with comparisons on choices both global and your friends if you want to live in another not to  far off time\\r\\n and have your actions mean something  play these games beyond two souls is the best game i’ve ever played i love it i like how realistic the graphics are to the tiniest detail from the hair on a persons face to rain falling on the ground i also like the choices you get and play the game the way and have multiple endings this costume says adult but a child’s size came there seems to be some glitch and the person at our local store said both description on the website adult and child list the same product number so he doesn’t think there is truly an adult one on the website needless to say my son was super disappointed and we almost didn’t get him one in time for halloween this year ive always been a zelda fan this is a really great game there are two worlds hyrule and lorule which are opposite kingdoms this is an amazing game as someone whos favorite zelda game of all time has always been a link to the past i think this serves as true successor the graphics are great everything moves fluidly the dungeons are very creative the items and the map are awesome also all the chibilike characters are super cute this is a must have game for zelda fans and a great game to start being one love love this game best game ever like animal crossing this is a forever keep game meaning i will never trade this game in never ever i was 10 year when the first zelda came for the nes it feels like a link to the past except with updated graphics running at 60 fps great updated music and new and exciting gameplay if youre a zelda fan this a nobrainer get the darn thing okay i am a hardcore zelda fan but this game was highly disappointing the dungeons are the smallest of any zelda game even minish cap had larger dungeons the ending although is the best ending of any zelda title since it is good vs good a great break away from the usual zelda games although the final boss was way to easy the baseball minigame was utterly boring and near impossible to control the fact that bombs and arrows are infinite is just plain ridiculous if they did a combination of finite arrows  bombs and they used the stamina meter it would have been more challenging hero mode certainly makes the game a bit harder but it isnt that difficult and the story is just very minimal the only real story dialogue happens at the beginning and the end this game has been effectively dumbed down the dungeons are cake the monsters are cake the puzzles are cake its as if the game developers gave up on the long time tradition of making a long lasting challenging and replayable game for a game of 40 dollars i feel as if the cost of each entertainment hour is not matched the rental of the equipment is a good idea especially since if youre 10 you probably wont die yet thats something that seems awry in the gameplay maybe i was expecting another great loz game like twilight princess even skyward sword was awesome the remake of oot was challenging and exciting with great graphics and gameplay style this is such a disappointment after waiting half a year id say this was not worth it for anyone beyond the skillset of a child this game is so boring its like watching paint dry a link between worlds has the dated snes graphics and lame gameplay this game is really fun with great puzzles and gameplay so it should deserve a 10 the only thing that was a little down was the music\\nbut everything else was perfect playing heavy rain and beyond two souls was a hit to my depression i’ve only played the detroit game so far but i love it it’s fun and entertaining the quantum dream collection is a must own for anyone who claims to be a serious gamer  these games could easily be major motion pictures due to incredible story lines scenic locations  and amazing characters  this company deserves every penny that they generate from game sales i hope they continue to flourish for years to come i think that all of these games are in short amazing these games are visually stunning and the stories they tell are one of a kind and unique something that i personally enjoyed a lot was the cast of voice actors who are actual actors who are notable and who many have heard of on top of that their visual likeness to their characters in game is superb i would highly recommend these games to anyone who enjoys a good story and a game where their decisions ultimately have an impact this was one of the best story lines i have played plus the graphics are remarkable and the details are so on point watch when the detective anderson pays cash for something the dollar bill is so detailed u can see the pyramid with the eye above it clear as day that’s things i look for really real looking love the move parts this game is awesome beyond two souls and heavy rain were on ps3 and on the sony store as ps4 digital downloads i do not have internet so for these to be released as a physical copy is a great thing detroit become human is fantastic obviously games are all opinion based if theyre good or not these games are my style i have played both heavy rain and beyond two souls before purchasing but i didnt own them i couldnt pass up the offer of all 3 games for the price of a new copy of detroit become human this was worth playing with mystery and suspense these games have great story dialogue having the player choose with intense consequences love it my best friend and i bought this a couple of weeks ago and we absolutely love it the graphics in the games are great as well as the plot grew up playing this game on the weekends and after school loved it and would have loved to keep the save files i had for it from over half a decade ago it plays just like super mario 64 i really like the game play you can even change spongebobs costume whether its mermaid man or fishing gear these games are experiences not just games i think to put it in perspective they aren’t your call of duty or boring first person shooter games they have meaning to them like your experiencing another life to me it’s beautiful i bought this for my son he hasn’t stopped playing this game for a while now he loves it ive watched some of those games years ago on yt and finally ive got the opportunity to play them and play detroit become human which seems to be a pretty good game i was so excited when i found out this game came out because i had wanted to play beyond two souls on the ps4 for a while long story short it didnt disappoint not really a big fan of two souls but the other two have a good story controls could use an upgrade tho each game has some great stories to tell but controls are very picky these games are very strong for story an have a so much influence by the player happy with it beyond two souls is passable and i haven’t played heavy rain yet but detroit become human is my favorite the androids are so good and so is hank rose and carl 1010 would throw connor off a cliff again i only wanted the one game because it is literally one of my most favorite games but the fact i got two more games on top of my game i wanted and the fact it was only 43 are you freaking joking that is the best price i have ever bought something for like omg i’m in love with the price it was i love game stop have been wanting to try detroit human but was skeptical buying the 3 pack made it easier was a excellent choice would have been happy just buying the 1 game the graphics were beyond expectations the storylines were just so well thought out then the fact you had a chance to do the dialogue with both characters at once idk if that’s ever been done before i love the game great graphics and interesting game play i bought it because it looked cool and came with two other games for free and it was a great purchase played them for 2 weeks straight now time to 100 tried it first then bought a copy game play is great replay value super high choices are near endless heavy rain was a leading game of its time the graphics are updated but the game is aging difficultly beyond is a game with mixed concepts although intriguing it can be hindered by game mechanics detroit human is where this five star rating is a must this game is beautiful crisp and you never know when the decision youll make will change lives peace or war obey or freedom sacrifice or living to fight another day its an amazing game where each character draws you in in different ways making you question truly what the best decision for yourself and or for everyone else is the concept of an aware ai has been in our eye sight for years but this game touches on the heart of it and demands the player to choose where they stand the draw backs would be the occasional forced story line where the choice you would make isnt an option lack of tutorial leaves the occasional negative consequences when an action was missed and lastly the game mechanics and view screen can on occasion leave you struggling to get your bearings but in all honesty these things are so minor the ending left me wishing theyd given us more but i see room for a second game and only hope the story just might continue overall this game left me emotionally ragged in all the ups and downs my people went through along with making me really feel and know every action could save or kill my character i give it a solid nine out of ten and a must play recommendation for anyone looking for a game where your decisions matter detroit is probably the best game ever yet to play the others do not buy this heavy rain was so laggy and unplayable heavy rain and beyond two souls were not formatted correctly for the ps4 waste of money especially considering i bought it new  meaning i cannot take it back or exchange it for another game even though i know that is gamestop’s policy take this review to heart folks i bought a week ago started 2 of the 3 games love it so far the game play is a little tricky at first but i definitely please with the games love the new style of play took a minute to get used to it but loved it all three of these games are wonderful achievements in interactive cinema especially detroit where your decisions impact so many aspects of the game it feels like a choose you own adventure book you find yourself replaying detroit over and over for the different outcomes and endings if you are looking for a lot of action and combat look elsewhere if you are looking for an interactive detective experience where your decisions have impact and the story unfolds like a movie these quantic dream games are for you i received this item right away and a great addition to my collection title says it all this comes in normal simpsons box they should have put this in treehouse of horror box no brainer received it in perfect condition in a timely manner uhhhhmazing it came packaged perfectly and they did a great job on time awesome piece service at the locations was ok i went to 4 or 5 different ones  2 of them were great to exceptional the others on the other i unfortunately can’t say the same i have a few homer funko pops and this is one of my favorites i appreciate the packaging but it was still damaged the item looks as if it was damaged before packaging thank you for the quick delivery though all 3 of mines came with dented corners on the outside box covering as a collector i now have to find one with a good box to add to my collection after putting it in a plastic protector its homer dressed as princess kashmir which never happened in the show funko has jumped the shark with the simpsons line very nice item just like the tv program homer looks great this is a true collection patience has been paid dearly i love playing detroit become human and the other two games with it are mind blowing i enjoy a great story line i like the game alot but i cant play online because i downloaded it from ebgamescom so i dont have a cd key so i cant play online but the game is challenging it gives you a feeling of how intense ww 2 was and you get an incredibly sweet feeling when you falnk the enemy and finish them the story is awsome because it shows it from another perspective it tells you alot about your charecter joe hartsock or red is a careing squad leader who would do anything just to get his men home in one piece but he realizes that he cant save anyone so he thinks hes there to shorten the casualties you have to take your men are part of the legendary 101st airborne youll need tactical excellence to get through this game but you also need to care for your men because you will need them to help you and if they die you have no chance so keep them alive i had received this smartwatch as a christmas gift and thus far havent had an issue with it it seems similar to the old pebble smartwatch i had a few years ago but its much better designed and has support for controlling media on my phone allinall the watch does as required and has a few neat features as well cant seem to download my music playlist not as easy as it says i got this watch as a gift about 3 weeks ago i love how it tracks not only steps but body battery heart rate stress level etc the emergency contact feature is very cool to keep people safe it hooks up to headphones easily and makes your music to easy to get to my only real complaint is the battery life it oy last 3 to 4 days before i have to charge it again with little use where as my fitbit would last 7 to 9 days all around it is a great watch and i have it personalized completely to my liking this product was purchased as a gift for my son he decided he wanted to go a different route best gift i ever got the features of this watch are easy to use i love being notified of text and email messages and the music download feature is convenient when at work having had competitors product this has exceeded my expectations i got this for christmas will not play music very disappointed with this tracker the watch does everything i wanted a watch to do provides me with all the tracking information i want for my activities and sleep plus i have downloaded all my playlists from my spotify account  to listen on my earbuds without carrying my phone with me date numbers should be larger with preinstalled watch faces received this as a christmas gift and i love it  but still a lot of features that i need to explore the device is working properly but it’s a bit more than i need i’m struggling to track my runs through the device or the app at one point a great run got messed up and i couldn’t adjust it very frustrating it’s user error but don’t buy more device than you need love the watch great price no it doesn’t have all the bells and whistles but it does what i need it to do a perfect gadget for health tracking every day training and activities made accurate and simple its slim design makes it easy to wear it all day long even when sleeping  bright screen clear to read under sunlight and moving gotta say although hydration widget doesnt works very well and i was looking forward to use this a lot also there are not so many compatible watchfaces nor activitiesdatascreens on connect iq which was a little dissapointing but overall it performs well love my venu great features looks sleek and super motivating it was a christmas present i love open water swimming so i was excited to get a garmin watch that my husband had been told would be suitable and the shop now i have to figure how how to get it to track open water swimming it won’t stay linked to iphone screen already had scratch marks this is my first garmin so the learning curve was steeper for me beautiful display fun watch faces to play with tracks loads of activities waterproof in the pool im having to charge it nightly but i have been playing with it a lot i havent yet used the gps function i do know the swipe across to change screens isnt working as well for me as the dial would next one for me will have a dial to change screens and will be solar powered rather complicated and touchy would like time visual all the time and too much to handle i bought this in tuesday the battery lasted so long\\r\\nall the features in the watch work well and fulfilled my needs screen doesn’t react to swipes taps etc we have tried everything my husband has a smart watch with which he has no problems  he couldn’t get this one to work at all i bought this a month ago and overall i like its features it tracks my runs it tracks my hydration it plays music after 3060 minutes of set up \\r\\n\\r\\nit is definitely not perfect the connection isnt amazing the screen is already scratched up from running and a desk job i dont know what i am going to do about the screen that is probably the most disappointing part dont wear it on the inside of your wrist i bought this to record high intensity workouts for the health program through work the battery life is good and its comfortable the strength app isnt super easy or intuitive to use but i like that i can edit workouts later the one major feature missing for me is a medicine tracker did i take it today not a reminder i have to record 1 second of martial arts every morning to remember if i took my pill even if i could add a custom type of workout that would satisfy it i also wish it could dynamically set an alarm based on where you are at in your sleep cycle around the time of your normal wakeup time i have owned a very large number of running watches and even tried the other guys but i kept coming back to garmin  i have now found the perfect watch for me it has a very readable screen and great functions  easy to operate with great graphics  love the square shape too nothing but love for this perfect watch not sure how but top r corner chipped and cracked screen after 1 run yikes just received the watch today   trying to set it up   the connect app crashes freezes during set up   the watch arrived set in spanish i think   how the heck do you change language settings this watch is everything i needed i am training for a half marathon and it has been great to have music in my runs without my phone with me ive had this watch about 3 weeks i wish the text size on the watch was bigger and that i can use my apple music app all other features are great this watch with the app is remarkable so many ways to track about every aspect of health and the venu sq sensors are very accurate i got the new venu sq as a bday gift id been rockin the vivoactive for several years now and it was about time for an upgrade i didnt want a round face so i was stoked when this model offered the square face i love all the extra activities that this watch offers and still waterproof ive yet to drown one and i swim a lot i am loving the hr and other health monitors that i didnt have on my og vivo my partner worries about me going for long runs when i sometimes dont take my phone stupid shorts with no pockets so the safety features that the venu sq offer are phenomenal also always having music is great the battery lasts for days and i go on a gps run every morning and a bike ride every afternoon and it seems to last forever all in all super happy with the upgrade bought it a month ago love it but cant get the spirometer to work i bought this about 2 weeks ago and i am quite satisfied with the performance i have been getting with the product\\r\\npros\\r\\n1 good enough battery life if you just use the gps to track your activity it will last you for about 4 days on a single full charge assuming you do a normal amount of activity per day 12 hrsday\\r\\n2 ui i personally like the ui very much you can go around and change stuff and also have the garmin connect and connect iq app support\\r\\n\\r\\ncons\\r\\n1 gps it can take about 5 seconds before the watch will lock your gps location and that can be a little irritating sometimes also sometimes the watch will get the wrong location at the start andor the end of your activity and hence the top speed achieved for that activity would come out to be something insane like 40 kmh or something\\r\\n2 battery life with music i cannot really complain about this since the company only claims 6 hours with gps and music on but i would have loved to have a longer battery life with music\\r\\n\\r\\noverall if you want to begin your fitness journey with a good smartwatch this is the option for you me acaba de llegar el reloj y me parece perfecto el color la forma y algunas de las animaciones que tiene así como la aplicación sin embargo en esta versión de música que compré no está youtube music en la cual tengo mi membresía ya paga sería bueno si pudiesen agregarla not much to the game you can’t get into an online lobby the game is so dead also game gets annoying with all the penalties from collisions with other drivers and hitting the cones but the cpu drivers hit the cones all the time and never get penalties smh also there’s no pitting in the game so that takes a lot of realism away it’s just a basic driving game graphics are good driving experience is good that’s about it my friend had a bit of a problem with getting his license fun game starting in noob mode starts out fun working your way up it just kicks butt it a great idea to have a truck racing game and the art work looks cool it’s really an challenging game as well as a awesome game to play different but in a wonderful way immersive skillful and a load of fun dive right in or i should say drive right in\\nthe game seems to be exciting and fun i really love my venu sq plus not expensive at all really a great investment and more feature than most of the watches on the market  i love the look how i can change out my bands face protection and all the different type of workout features makes me even more excited about my purchase no mistake in this investment i recently bought the garmin venu sq  music edition had i really paid attention i probably would not have ordered this particular watch i’m afraid the music features are lost on me as i’m not really into listening to music this way overall despite this feature i do like the info i get from this watch the synced mode isnt very viable the app says unable to find debice device says connected the sync to fitness isnt happening the fitness routine doesnt sync results  needless to say this is very disappointing i bought this a month ago and i wish i didn’t it was a big expensive watch that didn’t meet the needs i have and doesn’t work half the time i wish i saved my money i cannot figure out how to use itfrustrated please offer suggestions i bought this a month ago and i’m so glad that i did because it tracks everything for me the price is just right and it has a very impressive accuracy i overall am completely happy with this smart watch and it’s capabilities i bought this month and i was so happy  the garmin venue sq is awesome i bought this a little over a week ago and the connect app isn´t  working  i keep getting the message garmin connect is currently experiencing an outage  we are working to resolved it as quickly as possible and apologize for the inconvenience i bought this a couple weeks ago and its great love being able to track my workouts and foods the only thing i wish i could do is connect to pandora i live the capabilties of the watch just wish i could choose a larger font  i dont like running in my glasses so cant read anything until im done i bought it last month and am enjoying it and it has very many functions  no regrates just got this for my birthday and i love it i had an apple watch gen 2 and i love the the garmin so much more the battery life is amazing and it has been very easy  to learn how to use i recv’d my garmen as a gift it truly is one heck of a great watchh i took up running about a month ago and needed a watch that would connect to fitrankings for virtual runs does a good job tracking runs mostly all that i use it for easy to use seems accurate too many extras i dont have a need for but they are good if you are looking to get fit 6 years ago i purchased a garmin vivofit first gen loved that watch  well it finally succumbed to my constant wear and tear so i needed a new one i chose this one for ease of use simple affordable still figuring it out technology jumped a lot in 6 years can’t wait to really test her out i agree that figuring out how to use it can be overwhelming as it has many features with many options to customize however once you find the online and app versions of the manual you should have no problem figuring any of it out you do need to be patient with the gps connection make sure youre outside and wait 30 seconds but it works great im loving thus far after having for 1 week i bought this recently and soo happy with it i would buy it again just received this a few days ago  love it  was easy to set up  am 63and not tech savvy  it is light weight and very comfortable as well thank you garmin shout out to my wonderful husband who found this and bought it for me easy to use its a stunning watch absolutely love it preorder process was very easy and smooth and i am very excited to play this when it comes out my girl loved the game man she is up early right now playing it again thanks a lot‼️‼️ my son is a big michael jackson fan and has really enjoyed playing this game it didn’t work  i just tried it yesterday   i’m sure the game is great i used to have it years ago but the disc would  not play in either wii of course the songs are great and the dances are awesome my son and neighbors absolutely love dancing along to this game there are a bunch of songs and dancing levels from which to choose  ordering it through gamestop was easy and the product is in great condition one of the best games ever made wish they remake it i can’t rate it yet i actually put this gift in the back of the closet and forgot about it it was supposed to be a christmas gift oh my goodness i know she will love it i like the michael jackson the experience wii game it’s so much fun it is so complicated maybe it has too many features i went from a versa ii to this garmin venu sq and i try to follow the ‘how to’ instructions and get no where so unless you want to spend hours setting this watch up i’d try one less complicated i love micheal jackson and still listen to him till this day this game is exactly like just dance but strictly micheal jackson songsit even includes tutorials by dancers on the songs and moves micheal jackson did overall 1010 bought the venue music and the battery last longer than my wifes apple watch it also looks just like the apple watch with the same features  great watch so far i bought michael jackson the experience preowned online and the disk wouldnt read i cant return and get my money back at the store they say it has to be store credit i have heart issues and my doctor said stress is likely a factor this watch is great because it lets me know when my body is registering stress which is something i’d never noticed before it also tracks my sleep and my movementswalking this watch replaced my samsung s2  i was looking for a lighter more sleek smart watch and the venu sq  music was the perfect choice  im also currently using in conjunction with my noom app  has all the bells and whistles my s2 had and then some very happy i dislike the music function  i wanted it to play music from my phone library  all this does is play spotify and one other music function  that was one of the reasons i purchased this model watch so dissapointed i bought this watch a week ago i have taken it on several runs and love all of the features i wish it had wireless charging but that is not a huge deal i am extremely disappointed in the gorilla glass i havent hit it on anything and ive been extremely careful yet its full of scratches i bought this in replace of my apple watch i loved the features in the garmin and how it was set up but it doesn’t give text or call notifications that’s a deal breaker for me returning my watch uploading from my mp3 player via windows was very easy and fast  pairing with bluetooth earphones effortless  very easy to access and play music  exceeded my expectations i received as a gift  i needed something to act as a health monitor and a device that could act as an alert if  i fell perfect for both manual does not yet contain how to set upinstructions for all of their watches  the user manual does not give step by step instrucions on how to set up all the functions garmin offers  i asked chat how to pair again because somehow i disconnected it and after an half hour or more i received the notice that the user mime is the venusq with music  finally after an hour i called garmins support group and the technician was able to tell me step by step how to pair my watch again i bought this watch a week ago to monitor my health and to keep up with my workouts the watch is beautiful however i am having a difficult time setting up some of the stats through garmin app have not been able to connect to wifi and cant get the watch to sync music watching videos has not helped to remedy the problem i am sure it is me and not the watch will get one of my grandchildren to help me i love the watch but the band was super short i had to buy a longer one so i could wear it the battery runs down very quickly as well my son in law has a garmin that goes two weeks on a single charge mine only goes about 3 days spotify sinc is ok but the sound has problems this is disappointing and the end you have to carry your phone to listen music super happy with all the tracking options connects well with android phone feel like quality is as good as apple the size is smaller then expected and the display is not as clear as i would have liked it a lot to learn with a lot of pages and menus does not have an easy quick view of simple displayed like apple has also my bank is not a participant in garmin pay in hind site i should have spent the extra money and bought an apple i bought it two days ago  fully charged and used for six hours and battery life is already down to 40 i bought it thinking it had 6 day battery life but that was wrong advertising i got this as a christmas gift and i love it it was a great suprise my husbamd bought this for me as a gift i want to love this watch but it is not very accurate i use the eliptical a lot and the steps and calories are way off on this watch from my eliptical also the heart rate i did plenty of research and read reviews on this amd the fitbit versa 3 and decided on this one unfortunately it did not live up to the hype i will more than likely be sending it back i got this after being fitbit user for last three years  pros length of baterry ability to turn off and on pre programmed apps blue tooth  cons i got because i love to run spotify app sucks  period  it forced you to be tide to wifi connection  whats the point to add more if it will not allow you to hear using bluetooth technology  once you open it you need to download garmin iq garmen express to ensure all apps work without complication  we need to do something better i think ill return it by not meeting basic needs of modern era  get it done garmin staff make it change quick difficult time setting up music and could not get a signal for the gps to be able to set it up tried several times so i just gave up for now this review was collected as part of a promotion i recently got these h3 hybrid headsets from epos right off the bat they look very cute and stylish they fit perfectly over my ears on the right side they have the sound control and on the left side they have the mic connecting it over bluetooth is really easy and straight forward once connected as soon as we turn it on it automatically connects back to the same device the sound is pretty clear and crisp they are not that bulky adjusting the volume is like dialing a knob very easy i am loving these headsets and i do not have any complaints so far and yes i would not think twice to recommend these to my friends family and colleagues this review was collected as part of a promotion i bought these h3 hybrid gaming headsets for my son and i cant say enough they fit perfectly are easy on the eats and provides great enjoyment the sound is very clear and there have been no issues with them this review was collected as part of a promotion i recently received a pair of these headphones to try they are amazing  the sound quality is excellent pairing is very simple they work really well with our gaming system  im super excited to have these this review was collected as part of a promotion the hybrid h3 gaming headset has great sound quality i use them while playing my new playstation 5 and they sound perfect i had not had any issues at all while using them the headset is very durable and made nicely with high quality materials they sit soft on my head and are very comfortable while using i am amazed by the sound quality to me that is the most important while using a headset i can hear so crisp and clear while using them and it sounds so clear when i talk to other players these are definitely a pair of epic headphones and i would definitely recommend i use youtube music and that is not an option for music apps very disappointed i switched from my apple watch to a garmin and it is nothing like it tbe features are all basic not very fun to use for social media purposes wish i wouldve considered it more before purchasing i bought  this thinking will be the size of the fitbit sense and i get disappointed of thatnot getting use to a small watch i bought my watch not knowing it had a pulseox on it i started using it at night while i slept only to find out i needed supplement oxygen at night i showed my readings to my pulmonary doctor she had me wear a medicalgrade pulseox overnight and was put on oxygen 2 days later i find that the watch often will disconnect from my phone even when i have my phone next to me so i know it’s not because my phone is too far and out of range from my watch and the strength function on the watch could be made more user friendly i’d like to be able to set it and have it just run while i’m lifting weights but you have to constantly stop it input the reps and weight in between reps and then do everything all over again for your next set i also wish the app was more user friendly too i switched to the garmin from the fitbit because the garmin has more functions than the fitbit however the fitbit was a lot more user friendly than i’m finding the garmin to be i just got it and bluetooth it to my phone ♡♡ i love it i love my new garmin venu sq  its easy to use and keeps excellent data ive had this watch for about a week fits great very light weight low profile hardly feel it on my wrist i use it mostly for running gps is spot on and having my playlist on my wrist is a game changer its decent but really more than what i need most if the activities i dont even do and its not easy going from 1 screen to the next im considering sending it back maybe for something less expensive and less complicated stable bluetooth connection is basically impossible it pairs easily but will disconnect constantly the watch interface is extremely clunky and difficult to navigate ive had zero connection issues with each fitbit ive owned in the past probably a great watch with incredible features i was wanting but the connectivity issues was a deal breaker i bought this on april 132020 after not playing since i was 11 in 2011 and it’s still fun amazing i love it my family and i love it makes family night fun and its a free workout no gym needed it does not work i have to take it back to the store and get a replacement i have been working haven’t had a chance to do so i cant play it i cant even enjoy the experience i bought it for my kids bday and they cant even play it as you know michael jackson died in 2009 that’s why i got this game i got the game and it was scratched and it did not work great game for the family since i bought it the family  has been playing it together ever since love mj love the song selection highly recommended this is a good game i played it and the game is great for learning how to dance like him like the moonwalk amazing game me and my niece plays everyday after school she loves it and i love it way more i had it for 3 days and love the feathers that it offers the set of functions suits me for the money but touch screen control is difficult because the screen is small and not always sure about the accuracy of the selection instead it would be better to have two additional buttons on the left for scrolling and highlight the selected shade in such a competitive era i dont expect such quality from garmin if we compare it to that of sam active 2 that is more promisinhg and havubg good features very pleased with the watch to date long battery life great features and easy to operate i received the watch yesterday and wore it all night last night and through the day today the battery was at less than 30 less than 36 hours after i started wearing it i charged it to 100 before i put it on and charged it tonight i don’t want to have to charge it once a day integration with my 520 plus is good but instructions could be more precise  video instruction for each section would be helpful ie golf bike walk run etcpairing videos would also help i realise that some are available but a more logical progression  order would be beneficial  two days in and i really like the watch \\r\\npros  \\r\\nsize and shape square makes it easier to get a text message on the screen\\r\\nscreen colors look good\\r\\neasy music set up and headphone pairing took no time at all to get my spotify playlist on the watch and headphones connected\\r\\n\\r\\ncons\\r\\nsettings menu only available on watch itself  why cant this all be found on the phone app\\r\\nbattery is down to 40 after 15 days with 30 minutes of gps i have been tweeking settings and getting it set up so this may not be reflective of daily use\\r\\nlack of watch faces patience is hard d\\r\\ntext size  can you please make this adjustable my eyesight isnt getting better with age i was looking for a watch to track sleep and spo2 in addition to outdoor activities  for sleep it had to be light and comfortable to wear to bed  the venu sq is one of the lightest smartwatches ive worn and the silicon band is very comfortable so its easy to sleep with  it has a pretty simplified screen but has a lot of features  the gps performance is quite good and and for a mtb ride in valleys and trees it performs on par with the much larger garmin fenix 6pro  loading additional exercise modes music and clockfaces isnt the easiest but once its set up everything works great  for such a small and lite watch it is really packed with features ive had garmin watches forever and was looking to upgrade to one with music\\r\\ni love that i can now use my wireless earpods i also love the square watch as opposed to the rounded ones i previously owned  but i am very disappointed in the font size and the inability to increase it  even with my glasses i find it hard to read the text messages every time i close garmin connect on an iphone the phone disconnects  my garmin instinct never did this  about to send the venu sq back i really enjoyed this game it helps me keep moving to be perfectly honest with you all my children play this game everyday its awesome and worth every penny every time i purchase the greatest entertainer ever to grace this earth will continue to entertain i bought this recently and me and my family love this game my family has played this game everyday since i bought it even my teenage kids great for family time also a light workout i bought this about 2 weeks ago and me and the kids love it im a huge mj fan anyway so this was great great game that my family enjoys and loves very much very fun with one player or four would have liked more songs but overall it is a great game game only partly works some of the songs and features dont work my girls love it a bit pricey for a older game but no complains bought this game three times i love it kids love it even more this review was collected as part of a promotion well i gave this to my grandson and he immediately knew how to work it ad started running through the house flipping it from side to side he loves the sound it makes when it flips like racking the gun  this nerf gun is a hot this review was collected as part of a promotion i will start off by saying that we take our sunday family nerf wars seriously a quick loadfire is a must i only have one complaint this particular gun takes too much efforttime to fire each round which is a major downfall if you are wanting a nerf gun to just hit targets with no need for speed this is a great gun very accurate lightweight and a cool concept we only have one other gun that is part of the elite 20 series the shockwave which is one of my favorites i attached a side by side this review was collected as part of a promotion my 7 year old son loves everything nerf he loves this one it holds eight bullets four bullets go in at each end of the barrel after shooting the first four you flip the barrel and shoot the last four my son loves that feature it takes the elite bullets which shoot pretty far in this the green slide to flip the barrels also is a sight very cool with the flashy green color on it this review was collected as part of a promotion the nerf elite 20 flipshots flip8 is a great new asset to the nerf family my husband is a kid at heart and loves shooting alongside my two sons he loves the flip action and said the flip reloading action is exciting he was able to trick our sons into thinking he ran out of bullets but unbeknownst to them he flipped it on them and continued the nerf war they were definitely surprised it has great accuracy as well as power and precision you need to add the nerf elite 20 flipshots flip8 to your collection can’t recommend it enough this review was collected as part of a promotion my boys really enjoy this nerf gun it is different  and more exciting than the normal guns they have they love to rotate the barrels and keep shooting it is made well and works great it holds 4 bullets in each barrel for a total of 8 bullets it is easy to load it comes with 8 bullets but i do wish it came with a few extras it always seems that we lose a couple in the first couple days it has great force with the bullets and seems to shoot accurately a big hit for my kids this review was collected as part of a promotion my kids were super excited to get this nerf gun it is a toy i am ok with them using in the house since the darts are so soft it can sting a bit if you get hit up close but they figure it out my son is 5 and he was able to use it fairly easily after some practice but my 4 year old daughter couldn’t really grasp it just yet the process of flipping it around and reloading was a bit tedious it was something my husband had to constantly help them with especially because it would stick when trying to push forward to reload for whatever reason the darts are now falling out really easily when we put them in so i’m not sure how long the toy will last but they do have fun when they use it this review was collected as part of a promotion nerf guns are a must when you have three boys this one is awesome very sturdy easy to load easy to flip and even my six year old has no problems using it i like that it holds eight bullets so they spend less time reloading its great this review was collected as part of a promotion i’ve been a mom for almost 20 years we’ve owned a lot of nerf guns over that time and let me say it never gets old this nerf elite 20 flipshots flip8 was so much fun easy to use comfortable to hold and just looks cool this review was collected as part of a promotion this is the best need gun my son just lives this one and says its so different fro the rest i will most defintely buy and i will most defintely recommend this need gu m to my very close family and friends in will most defintely will buy fi r my boys o r a gift for my boys friends this review was collected as part of a promotion nerf has come such a long way in making the nerf guns much more fun and better this nerf gun is huge my son and nephew love it so much its really big but very easy to use and lightweight kids and husband and brother all loved playing with it and are now looking for additional ones to buy for everyone great product well made nerf is a solid great company that makes great products fun for all ages i purchased this on the game stop website the copy we were sent was a fake and it did not work correctly authentic and in great shape works fine on new 3ds xl amazing game great pricecompared to retro games stores my copy functions but the cartridge separates at the seamidk if correct word did not come with original case cartridge had a hacked save on it  the game is awesome pokémon black seems to be made for more advanced players which i find fantastic more adventurous and having to explore every town and house in it i was actually pretty surprised my copy also arrived in its original case solid game and story line i hadn’t played a pokémon game since 2006 diamond was my last game so just wanted to get back to playing black was a good refresher price seems a bit too high compiared to when it originaly came out and campared to the price i bought that i lost might of dropped in the trash no case but is authintic gamecard and is one of the nessasery games to have to transfer pokemon from 3rd gen up to the 6th gen games and beyond i love this game the story music characters and pokémon are all great pokémon black and white are easily one of the best pokémon games in the series this is definitely a must have for pokémon or rpg fans in general after three weeks to arrive we received a defective game my son is heartbroken that we cannot get a replacement in a timely manner \\r\\n\\r\\nhe was able to play it for a few minutes and greatly enjoyed it until he got an error liked this game since the release date had to repurchase my 9 year olds love this they have discovered iconic michael jackson music  dance and we could not find this 2010 game anywhere but here the graphics are definitely not the same level as a 2018 game but we appreciate being able to still get this great wii game i hope wii comes out with a 201819 version soon i bought the game on line for my son and an error comes up when installing this is the best dancing game ever due to the fact that it is based on michael jackson the artist with the highest selling album in the world thriller 1982 it has all of jacksons greatest hits with his iconic dance moves i would recommend this to all michael jackson fans and dancing game fans the game itself is good if youre a big micheal jackson fan the dance moves are usually the same as in the videos also you can unlock little dance videos from mjs choreographers or people who just downright danced for the game what i always find funny is looking at the legs of the in game dancers because those were videotaped with photoshopped glow around it what i honestly dislike is even if you do get the gold move the game wont recognize it as well as the fact that in general the choreography is pretty hard over all an ok game its a great game to dance to by learning the actual moves like michael jackson had so much fun dancing to the game i love this game it is actually like a good work out you just dont know youre doing it lmao but i think this game rocks on i agree with duymus from melbourne fl  this game is no fun and a waste of time i owned it like twice and this game and i just dont get along for one thing whenever id play it in my room i dont have enough room in my bedroom to dance to it so this game totally bites i bought this game because other reviews said it was a good workout if you actually move your body and not just your arms and get into the dancing you will definitely break a sweat and get a workout warning about the game though you should definitely play in a wide open area with high ceilings great buy i love this game its so much fun learning how to move just like him after watching his videos for so many years even my daughter tried it and she is 6 this review was collected as part of a promotion fun nerf gun flips to fit 8 darts and unloads fast and easy to reload nice size and not heavy to run with or hold easy to navigate as well yes it is fun to play with it and exciting overall love it so far it works well we havent had any issues with it its a great game okay i played this back when i was somewhere around 5 it was my heart and soul even if i couldnt get past the electric gym a few years later i load up the game again and get past the ground gym before turning off the game again havent played it since and just now am i noticing how much i love the music the designs the areas and just the game and pokémon in general i was born and raised on mario most i got out of story was bad man capture princess go rescue princess but what i remember is an amazing sight i wont spoil any of it but when i eventually go back through and see reshiram on my ds again it will be a delight to hear the title theme rival theme gym battle theme gym battle last pokémon theme and jam out to the low health theme im serious they took the doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo and turned it into an entire bop\\r\\n\\r\\ni highly recommend this to anybody who loves pokémon these nostalgia googles cloudy they may be will never be taken off since they were given to me by a dear friend  whos name was oshawott even though i lost my copy one day ill see my little friend again someday somewhere i bought the first one and it arrived visibly corroded i took it back to the store and ordered another one the second one looked fine but it didnt work when inserted into the game i had to make another trip back to the store i am not impressed great game missing link to get all my pokemon from when i was a kid to swsh great service too almost impossible to find a legit copy these days classic pokemon game that will never go out of style it’s not the newest game but pokémon is pokémon and it always fun i expected this to happen the game seems to not read on my 3ds im trying to see if i can fix it the game is a really fun pokemon adventure with a great story and a lot of great locations to go to bought the preowned but it wasnt even working opened it and it was entirely scratched up my copy hasn’t arrived yet but this is my favorite game of all time so i know its gonna be good team plasma and the story there is so good the music so rememberable everything about this game i adore im excited to make my 100th tepig save and catch haxourous  sorry if i spelt wrong and excadrill  that too if i could give it 10 stars i would awesome with a group of people for a party also great for lowering the fat bulge areas this game is an awesome party game to play if you buy it youll like it and it will turn into to love it after a while that youve played it itll start to get a little boring and youll move on but one day youll look back at all your games and say i miss this game and then youll play it like you first got it again this is the most amazing game i have ever played in my entire life those of you that havent played this need to it is the most amazing experience you may ever have o awesome game get it1111 it is a great game for fans and it has every one of his best songs that topped the charts but the gameplay is a little harder than just dance this game is just amazing to say the least its perfect for all age groups and types of gamers after playing this game i will never pick up and just dance game if you havent tried michael jackson the experience your missing out and you should give it a go you wont be dissapointed i purchased michael jackson the experience friday after work and let me tell you it is wonderful my daughter and i started playing as soon as i got home after five we had so much fun it was after three o clock that morning when we decided to stop playing and go to bed thank you so much for this game cool gamemichael jackson rock this was the most awesome game i ever played in my life its fun and great exercise great for mj fans this game is great for party gamers and its great for whoever likes micheal jackson i love this game and i hope they come out with a 2nd version of the wii my daughter asked if i would purchase this as she had it many years ago and really just wanted to collect the game as well as play itthe purchase was a good christmas gift i thought the price was a little high considering the ds is pretty much becoming obsolete i paid around 40 somethingshould have been at least halfmight consider a mark down on the ds games as you can purchase a lot of them on many different platforms ebay marketplace etci will continue to purchase from game stop when my family member wants a specific game there was very friendly staff at this location and i of course love the game great game it came within 2 days packaged very carefully one of the best in the series havent finished it yet but the game is awesome so far feels like a fresh game even though some of the pokemon are lame game got here quick and in good condition i have logged so many hours into this game just exploring all the areas and reexploring plus the post game has many things to keep you occupied including connecting with friends via entralink and a battle subway i collect all of the pokemon games and love everyone of them ive always been a pokémon fan so this review is going to be a bit biased\\nit is nintendos first try at making pokémon semi 3d it has a great story ingame with bad guys and good guys alike and a bunch of great new pokémon to catch and places to explore  another amazing installment in the franchise this game is amazing even if it doesn’t have much to it trading is always available great game that stays true to pokémon while providing alternate accustomed storyline and characters great addition to your collection if you’re a fan of the pokémon franchise definitely pick this up along with white i love this game its perfect for everybody i do it by myself to and with my gf and i do smooth crinmal like no bodys buisness heeeee heeeee i really love this gameits very fun when we have parties we play it i received this game as a christmas gift i swear it is the best money my friend ever spent on me i play a few times a week as a great exercise routine i havent gotten my husband to do try it yet but i keep trying i took it to a friends to just try and she bought one about a week later then she calls and has me come over and play so she can kick my butt didnt happen she only won two but it was so much fun it didnt really matter any one who likes michael jackson songs will love this game highly recommended my grandkids brought this game over to play we had fun with it and i got hooked had to go out and buy my own with all the different moves and variety of songs it provides a good workout for me im loving it i love this game my 2 year old plays this game and he does very well with it all my friends love this game when they come over i cant wait for them to come out with the 2nd version of the game i really like this game very fun i wanted this game since it was released got it after the price drop good decision very addictive especially if you are a true mj fan but wish more songs were on the game just being a little greedy i played it at a friends house for the first time about a month ago i havent been able to get it off my mind since i received it as a birthday gift and now im use it more than expected its a great game when entertaining a small group of guest or even by yourself i hope they consider a part ii with more songs for the most part i highly recommend this game enjoy this game is very because the game has all of mikeal jacksonhit songs on it this game is totally awesome not only do you get to dance to some of mjs greatest hits but you also get the workout of a lifetime his moves are legendary i bought this game a month ago  and it was very dirty i understand that it was preowned but if the previous owner is going to sell it they should at least clean it or the employees in the store\\r\\n\\r\\noverall it was authentic and working fine that’s why i give it 3 out of 5 the game is great but my cartridge works 50 of the time was very happy that the game was still in good shape and not a fake copy store did due diligence to check and i was happy to hear that i definitely have nostalgic feelings for this game so that could impact my score but i definitely recommend that a good game works just as it is stated to love it pkmn black is probably one of my favorite games  its an amazing soft reset of the series only allowing you access to the new pokemon untill gane completion this will probably always be one of my favorite pokémon games of all time it has been for as long as i can remember we bought so many games at a great price that we havent even played it yet pokemon fan here very happy with my old school ds lite great game and the story is the best of the pokémon games if you’re into a more jrpg style then this version is for you i only gave it a 4 cause white is better imo the exclusive pokémon in not only the regular game but also white forest are what make it better also aesthetically a couple places look rustic in white but futuristic in this and i don’t like that as much in this either game is great historical ww1 shooter a lot of free dlc was given to the players and the game has great gamplay and beautiful graphics it is not a good game the best battlefield ever and wanted to get it for my pc and wanted to play it so bad im mainly writing this to help the games review on gamestop but it doesnt deserve a 37 that its listed at if you like shooters and huge maps lots of sniping space vehicles 40 players and great graphics stop wasting time and start downloading this game my only downside to it really is the download size its enormous 50gb this game is probably one of the most realistic fps ive played the game play is amazing not to mention a history lesson the game is intense when you put a good gaming headset on you can hear the bullets wizzing by its pretty crazy online play is intense and fast paced the multipul arrays of vehicle choices and different weapons make for a game that keeps on giving battlefield has strayed from what made it great and is now turning into the pile of garbage known as call of duty if you want a good ww1 game get verdun its cheaper and actually realistic absolutely 0 lasting appeal no desire to play this at all the overall concept of the game is good i do like how the game comes with new features like the bayonet charge i also like the options of a vehicle having the capability of holding a lot of people what i do not like is the game is full of glitches this is not a wellpolished game at all it leaves a lot to be desired if you have a fps that you already like and know this may not be a good choice for you the vehicles being able to carry multiple passengers are the only good feature about them the viewing angles are awful and while this might be historically correct is does not make for good game play shotguns are ridiculously over powered people one shot from halfway across the map as well as handgun sniping seems to be happening too i don’t know if this a cheating issue or a skill issue the last point i would make is that all the servers have very low tic counts this can make for some very short games more load time then actual play time i would only recommend this game if you are looking for a game that takes place during this time period or you would want a fps while not having one that is current with the game barely coming out it is in fair quality the game has amazing rendering graphics and sound environments the games campaign is quite an experience with action packed scenes and thought out storyline the playstyle is similar to bf3 and 4 but has some really outstanding additions to the game the only bad part that is standing because it was just released the multiplayer is not balanced i feel as though the game gives you the worst weapons to start off with its understandable to give beginners ok weapons but the ones you receive are absolute garbage also at the moment some of the aiming for non single fire bolt action is slightly off missing shots when you know you hit them it is not any connection problems or game lag that is affecting my biased opinion as i have an amazing computer and 45 or so ping the game is fun and it makes you want to keep playing for a higher score i gave it a 8 on game play because sometimes it dont pick up on your move even when you are right the remote has to be held in the right position i have a wii it might be better on xbox 360 with the kinect also the facial graphics are a little blurred but i guess his body movement is the important part of the game overall if not for the little things id give it a 20 though mj has passed away this game will always keep him in our memories i bought this game because i love michael jackson and i fell in love with this gamei had a baby 14 months ago and was having a hard time losing weight i lost 6 inches since christmas dancing with this game you can just stand there and move the controller and get perfects but what fun is thatexcellent work outmy kids and i enjoy playing this game dailyquick warning if you have not danced or moved i suggest you stretch beforehand or you will be very sore the next day the game is awesome with the graphics and everything an excellent game and its well worth your time and money this game is loads of fun perfect for partysit takes a while to get used to so it is a little hard at first you have the option of following along with michale or following along with the backround dancers they have a whole bunch of his hit songs and the lyrics on the allows you to sing along i love this game its perfect for any mj fan what a great game last year my 6 yr old son did a mj dance to beat it for my 40th bd i didnt know he know who mj was it was the best present for my bday i got this game for him for xmas and we had a ball all night long we then had a party with other family members and we battled to see who was the best mj game game for families to get together and have some fun i grew up a micheal jackson fan and so are my children we all love playing this game together actually we spent new years eve playing all night i  we love this game i bought this game and was ready to go all out but it has disappointed me with some songs because they suck and gets really boring and really i think there are about 35 good songs thats it so thats why i think its ok but dont plan on keeping it\\n\\ni would highly recommend just dance 1 and 2 these games are great and i love it this game is great for all if you want to work your butt off and attempt to dance like michael or his background dancers then this is a great game i have shook everything i got and had a blast playing this game it only took me a second to realize i am no michael jacksonlol i am determined to master dirty diana and the way you make me feel awesome awesome awesome game just what i was looking for authentic nintendo version of pokémon black thank you been looking to get an extra copy of the game for some time black was my first game and i have always adored it the plot characters and world are wonderfully done and teach a beautiful story of the truth of ideals and friendship with a mysterious character with a good heart n i’ve completed the game and the national dex years ago but wanted to replay through the story in a way that would allow to save my game without having to delete my original play through and progress i was able to find a very nice preowned copy at one of the gamestops bear my house and was so ecstatic to play through the game again as i had desired  10 out of 10 stars from this nostalgic female  young adult i am 100 happy with my purchase and would certainly recommend this title to anyone  love this story more than any other pokémon game thus far along with the awesome characters and trainers and the pokémon—especially my reshiram and the starters oshawott is seriously the best definitely recommend played game before and loved it then now i got it for my daughter i like the game a lot it is a great game i might come back for some more games that you can catch legendary pokémon it is also the beginning of legendary black and white treasure something was wrong with the cartridge because i couldnt even turn the game on i returned it the next day game cartridge was defective   tried on 3 separate systems and it would not play   they should test games before they sell them i bought again for my son who lost it during a move i didnt like the game when i bought it when it was released but when i played through it again i loved it like any other pokemon game i recently received this as a gift and while i havent finished it yet i am enjoying it my first introduction to the series was actually in the 7th gen games and it was a little tricky getting used to the lack of some of the new features but now that i have gotten used to it im really enjoying playing through the puzzles in the gyms and working through the story i bought this a month ago and im glad that i did picked up in store love sersi and this pop great details love the sword great addition to my mcu collection you neded this game shop now this game this game is asome my sister got this game for christmas and brought it up to my house we had my whole family playing it it was so much fun i had to go out and buy my own so i could play it more this game is a lot of fun there are a lot of songs however i wish there were more or at least be able to unlock songs if you can unlock songs then i just havent yet yes sometimes you have to ask which one is michael but hey they did their best it is a great game and will give you a work out micheal jackson the experience is the best danceworkout game ever it is very fun at parties also it is e for everyone which is also great the graphics are tremendous most songs look a lot like his videos i picked this game up just for the heck of it yesterday and let me tell you that my family and i were hugely disappointed in the approach used to make it even my kids were not very interested in it after very long the whole game and everything about it is flawed my whole family is hugely into michael jackson and if he was still alive to see this horrible game hed sue the heck out of ubisoft for trying to attach his name to it just for it not meeting his expectations alone it does have alot of songs which is nice and yes they are his but whats so annoyingly awful about the about the whole thing is that the character is more like a cartoony silhouette that was mapped over someone whom only knew half of michael jacksons moves the mj training videos are only like 10 seconds long and tell you absolutely nothing that you didnt know before the dancing part is focused more on your hands which is understandable because of the wii remote but that is still no excuse for the lousy dancing used in the game because everybody knows that michael was always about fancyfootwork alot of the dancing doesnt even match the original dancing done by michael and appears like somebody just winged it pretending to be him simply because they got paid to do so the game is just a huge wasted effort this is not a game i would recommend to anyone and neither would michael jackson himself anyone that truely adores him should steer clear of this horrible waste of time game that attempts to take on michaels name because it simply isnt even worthy enough of it and dont even get me started on the kinect version its even worse ok when i saw the commercial for this game i was like who would play that dumb gameim a big mj fan tho so anyways my cousins got the game when i went over their house that weekend so i played the game and i was hooked we played for 5 hours it is so fun especially with other people i got the game for christmas and ever since i i opened it ive been playing it it is so fun the only thing is make sure you have a big area to play because they will not count the moves or you can get and ok intsead of and excellent my best is thriller i got 5 stars and an 11465 get at me lol hours of family fun it will keep a party going on for hours definitely worth the price this is a fun and great game to play with everyone for parties get togethers and play only it is a work out but a great game the best game for 2010 hope they make another one they done a great job on the moves for mj just like in his videos and u have to be just like micheal learn all his moves just like ur really him i bought this for my wife for christmas 2010 she is a huge mj fan this has all the songs you could want  great looking graphics on the wii she has been dancing since she opened it 8 hours ago we havent played wii in months i think this did it for her thanks ubisoft now i can get another big screen for me and play my games this game is the first movement game i have played and the best by far i did not even know i was sweating because i meant to do every move right and it is a riot because people get their dance look and are determined to do the right move hilariousthis is one the entire family can enjoy but get an extra copy for the kids folks this game can easily compete with the newer titles it is a great game loads of fun this game has a compelling story compared to previous titles as you travel across the unova region the gameplay feels refined and the spritework is just beautiful i would recommend this to any pokémon fan that owns a ds it gets way too much hate and not enough praise definitely worth the money i actually already have a copy but i bought the new one for a friend this game is your classic pokémon game and is amazingly fun as usual compared to older games it has almost no previous pokémon until you beat the league still amazing though yep its a replay i wanted to play it again because i didnt remember the story im glad i did i am finding it way more interesting than i did the first time i played it through i brought this game a few weeks ago and i love it this is my first time playing pokemon black and it has surprised me bought it 2 two weeks ago and still i am playing it i like playing old school games and this did the trick i am so happy i bought this game i would buy another in an heart beat i haven’t stopped playing since i got it home could be a bit deaper but all and all i’ve really enjoyed it so far already planning on picking up black 2 bought this primarily for my 5 year old sonhe loves michael jackson he loves it i love it and so does my daughter 7 years old it can be difficult to do some of the moves but the kids thoroughly enjoy this game its also a great workout this game go hard best dancing game ever i will keep this game it is easy to play and a good workout the song selection is great there is music for every mj fan this game i bought it for my girlfriend she loves mj im not that much of a dance game fan but this game i have to say is a lot of fun the music is good but some of the moves are a little too hard i recommend this game to people that like dance games and mj music this game is awesome in so many ways sure does make you sweat though if you really get into it only reason i gave the gameplay a 9 is because its hard lol mj is not easy to mimic lol but his song choice is nicelove the different options some songs you can be mj himself or you can be the backup dancer some songs are duos again you have a choice who you want to be i have to say my favourite mj song is beat it and i totally rock the dance for that song\\nif you are a huge mj fan this game is for you i been a huge mj fan since i was a kid and can totally appreciate this game and what its worth we brought this game home with our wii  it was one of the two games that made the family decide to even get that console  and popped it in pretty quickly after dancing to one song even my mother who truly isnt a fan of video games in any shape or form except for the occasional arcadestyle game wanted to play we managed to spend almost three hours just having sheer fun with this trying out the songs dancing along singing whatever\\n\\nit has to be as the review title says the most fun any of us has had in who knows how long mom says that even when she used to dance at bars with my dad on the weekends from the time it opened to the time it closed it wasnt near as much as this and i think i can compare it to my boxplaying days back when leaves were the big thing you know its a great family game lyrics and song content somewhat aside and as long as you can have fun you barely even realize that youre getting tired dancing like this is some of the best exercise available i think and if the just dance games are anything at all close to this well be picking them up as soon as possible its probably the best investment weve made for the family in some time and thats saying something if we could give it a score higher than ten we would\\n\\non a more detailed note the game reads the controllers surprisingly well  you truly have to have fun dancing you cant just move your arms it reacts to your overall motion which ive heard some dance games fail miserably at  the graphics are very easy on the eyes which could make or break a game the concept is simple and addictive there are no trick levels or anything like that just dance routines that you may need practice to pass accurately and even though the tracks are all from the same artist there actually is very little concern about the replay value dropping something i was seriously worried about as there are so many catchy tracks that its not even a question its a hard game but in a great way  youre not ready to smash the controller ever  and really its so balanced that its going to be hard to beat as games go on if they ever make a sequel sort of thing well be one of the first lined up to grab it this game is totally awesome in every way i love the dance moves they are so fun to perform its is the best workout ever you will workout with the dance move to unlock to go other moves my family had so much fun its a great family gamebut you need to master the move to really get thru it each step lots of fun for partys i could not wait for it i love his game its not like ddr or just dance its alot more workout with ur remote u have 2 whatch how he moves with his glove and u have 2 dance just like him im telling if u want a workout this is ur game right here it will make u sweat to death a fan or no fan lol this game is everything i wanted and more it has all his great hits and famous moves i had so much fun just singing along with the songs and feeling like i was making my own music video if u like michael jackson you will like this game as a mj fan i recommend this to anyone yea it is made by the same ppl as just dance but i like it way better you can choose to be either the back dancer mj dance partner with their own difficulty the dancing is not as easy as it looks sometimes and very fun as for the background and graphics they are amazing very interesting its like being in the music video im so addicted now the brand is the number one in my eyes and so many others  it is not expensive and are used in many items and they last a long time fair price for this large package of batteries cheaper than the name brands but they last longer than the super cheap ones whats the mah nowadays folks want to know the mah since batteries are becoming more and more important every day this review was collected as part of a promotion they work really well last a lil longer than any other brand this review was collected as part of a promotion i used these batteries in my old faithful mag light flashlight and they provide very bright light and so far are still going strong this review was collected as part of a promotion i put these batteries into a flashlight last month and they are still working this review was collected as part of a promotion d 4pack high energy alkaline batteries are powerful and long lasting this review was collected as part of a promotion these  d 4pack high energy™ alkaline

collected as part of a promotion i have been using this battery over two weeks regularly and it is working very well in the flashlight so far i am happy with the battery this review was collected as part of a promotion i  just love these rayovac batteries just what i needed for my large flashlight both are awesome and the game came with two shiny event pokemon from 2013 go used copies so far really enjoying this game id been a long time player of pokémon games and id recently been buying some of the older games i missed game went blank after halfway through game\\r\\nreturned to a different store in waco tx awesome sales rep he always helps my special needs grandson every time we visit extremely pleased that i was able to get this game again easy to understand and perfect for someone who wants to get into pokemon i gave this game a four out of five only because it took a bit longer for my package to be get here and due to the fact that it didnt come in its original case great graphics and a pretty good storyline just got this a week ago and loving it one of my favorite gens of pokemon hello i had previously ordered pokemon black  there was a guarantee on the game so i wasnt necessarily worried about it working or not  i waited about 45 days for delivery no big deal there and when i got it the back of the actual game where you can see the teeth looked to be almost rusted or degraded so badly that my 3ds couldnt even read the game  so i had waited 45 days for nothing and had to drive half an hour to the nearest gamestop to do an exchange  the staff were super friendly and patient about my issue but it still kind of stinks that i had the issue in the first place  this little occurrence doesnt push me to order online again from gamestop  be careful what you wish for the game arrived on time and in good condition my son has played it nonstop since it arrived black came in the mail and now i play black it is a fun pokemon game not only was this the first pokemon game i was truly interested in as a kid but i continue to love it to this day ive played the game over eight times each time training unique new pokemon from the unova region on top of the new and fascinating pokemon from pokemon black came a very compelling story that has defined the pokemon world the story challenges the ethics of capturing pokemon led by the nefarious team plasma serving under the seven sages and lord ghetsis ghetsis also seeks to gain more power and capture the pokemon himself so he trains a boy named n who eventually becomes the king of team plasma n is an especially remarkable character in the pokemon universe because his developments as a character left us all loving him even more i absolutely love this game and it has defined my love for pokemon from the beginning from the amazing story to the awesome gym leaders to the beautiful towns and cities pokemon black offers so much for players that is an absolute must have got the game on the day the preorder shipped and i am thoroughly pleased with the game\\n\\nit plays well albeit a bit too reliant on perfect motions and really gets you into it\\n\\nthe song selection is vast and the entertainment value is high\\n\\nyou get to pick whether you want to follow mjs choreography or the back up dancers and it gives you a difficult for both\\n\\nthe only real thing i didnt like about this game was its lack of a tutorial there is no way to learn how to play other than simply playing you catch on fast but it would have been nice to have one\\n\\nall in all the game is a good one and i will be playing it for a long time im sure i like this game much i am a michael jackson fan and i preorder the game i like so much guys you need to play this game this review was collected as part

same 8 pack never usednot past expleaked on shelf in house love the gameown 2nd versionwanted first version to play too it was the worst game in my entire life and the graphics didnt look to real injustice gods among us is from the people who bought everyone the one and only mortal kombat series this game is a lot like mortal kombat only with dc superheroes and villains every fighter is great in the game it only depends who you like the story mode is very deep and exciting plus the extra content is a bonus for the ultimate edition overall great fighting game i was going to buy the basic game but took a chance and went for the ultimate edition really glad i did the extra added characters and features makes it well worth the little extra so many skill levels will entertain new players and old die hard fighter fans alike always great playing the dc heroes and the baddies too would recommend to anyone thinking of buying the basic you wont be sorry i think its a perfect game i love it and the best part is that the are making a second one on xbox one one thing i think should be upgrade is the moves the should put a lot more power moves and stuffhope the second game is just as good all in all not a bad game tho is does have its minor cons and let downs but like i said all in all not bad deff worth every penny this game while very disappointing is a very good game for new players to fighters the game overall is a very fun game with a well balanced lineup of characters 3 words best graphics everif this was a shooter game it would notbe argued about with battlefield fans and cod fans besides the fact that the regular game has awesome characters really really awesome including 6 new characters awesome and i would slightly violent i would not recommend for 7 to 9 year olds but seriously the fact that you can pla on mobile devices is awesome injustice gods among us regular edition is awesome 3 on 3 combatics is awesome darkseid is awesome superman is awesome batman is awesome would totally recommend this game was awesome i love it its so exciting to fight against villains and superheroes my xbox 360 broke so im getting an xbox one hope it runs smooth on the new system wowthat is all i can say forget about eating sleeping and cleaning the gutters because this is all you will be doing for like ever you can be super heroes and stuff and also the bogus bad guys that try and cramp their style oh and there are like locations from the comics that you fight in and stuff scorpion from mortal kombat is along for the ride too because its freaking scorpion if you liked hello kittys island adventure you will absolutely love this freaking game grilled cheese is a good lunch i have all the pokemon games and i have to say this was really good i loved most of the new pokemons and loved the new pokemon transformations and events the story was nice and n was the best character created the unova region is one of my favorite regions in all the pokemon games this game would be a great way to start very nice game to play although play too long and get a headache super cool i live it 1010 epic  ign pokemon black is a really great game but it has some stuff i hate the story in pokemon black is a really fun and interesting its about a team trying to take away pokemon from all trainers but im not going to talk too much about that the story is not too long or too short 1 of the problems i hate about this game is most pokemon look weird i know its not a new thing but they should improve the gameplay is awesome they changed some of the battling moves so they look cooler now and sometimes when you are playing the camera turns in different angles so it doesnt feel like some blocky world a other problem is when you finish the story you dont really have nothing to do except catching them all but there isnt that much pokemon unlike the other games after all pokemon black is a really greatfun and awesome game and you can play with your friends like in the other games so i really recommend to play this game if you are a pokemon fan now compared to nintendos last few pokémon releases this one is by far the greatest the graphics are great and the overall gameplay and storyline are stimulating enough to not put this game down definitely the greatest release since leaf green i did enjoy my gameplay and is a perfect game for kids it is a good story mixed with exciting side missions you can get 8 gym badges and beat 8 gym leaders and fight tons of people around citys and towns you explore  great graphics the best in a long time till they came out with all of the new pokemon x  y and also pokemon black  white 2 graphics theyre upgraded since heartgold and soulsilver and by that i mean it uses more 3d and the backsprites in battles are animated but animated backsprites doesent mean that it looks good it actually looks pretty bad compared to the still ones from the previous games the pokémons are also cool and creative dont let the annoying gen 1 fanboys trick you gameplay the gameplay is just like hg and ss but there are new triple and double battles at random theres also a few more new pokémon moves and tms arent destroyed when you use them thank god oh and you cant walk with pokémon  that sucks after all ss and hg are just more fun and bigger games black and white are good starter games if its your first time but theyre only good starting games hg and ss are great starting games story the story is good i wont spoil anything i believe this is a stop up from most of the pokemon games but thats just my opinion with the improved animation and new pokemon it makes for a brand new experience that i have never before seen and ive grown attached to the game and with all the new pokemon to train level up and to battle with online this game will last a lot longer than most games this is a huge step up from heartgoldsoulsilver its great easy to start off and once you get into it easy to master hi i recomond this game because when i played black 2 at the end of the game in nevema town you find out what happend to you after you try to find n and black play this preowned to get gamestop power up points this review was collected as part of a promotion i have used these batteries since i got them and they are still going strong with no signs of losing its power i put them in a high wattage flashlight that i use everyday and i love how great they work i have had these batteries in my flashlight for over two weeks and they are still going strong this review was collected as part of a promotion put these d batteries in our automatic trash can which gets used very often throughout the day and still working strong even after a month this review was collected as part of a promotion i received these a couple weeks ago were using them in my sons swing so far so good hes a happy camper this review was collected as part of a promotion good dependable battery put them in our trail cam last month and they are still going strong the camera is motion activated so it takes many pictures we needed a battery that we could depend on and rayovac definately is this review was collected as part of a promotion i used these batteries in a batterydraining shower radio the batteries wear down so quick but these batteries from rayovac lasted a lot longer and for the price they are definitely a great value this review was collected as part of a promotion i got these batteries to go in my lantern that i use when the electricity goes out i have to say they make it brighter than previous batteries and they seem to last longer as well i will definitely be buying these batteries in the future i will also be replacing the batteries in all of my flashlights with rayovac this review was collected as part of a promotion i used these batteries and they worked great for my heavy duty flashlight would definitely recommend to all my friends this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries seem to have a very long live still working in mytrash can and put in awhile ago this review was collected as part of a promotion these are very comparable batteries to any of the other name brand batteries i always buy these when buying batteries because they work just as well and they are lower in price purchased as backup batteries with expiration of december 2018 last night i offered 2 packages for family member did not expect see acid awesome  injustice gods among us is a good but not great game however there is a scropian dlc so it kind of makes me want to pick it as ive only played the demo people who love street fight tekkan  mortal combat i would highly suggest at least taking a look at the game i think it was an awesome idea for this game but some characters i think could have been better like bane could have been the newest bane or for a dlc most people like the dark night rises bane but they could have added different characters like killer croc beast boyor something like that but the original copy was a great game i never played this copy but from what ive played the game is awesome and i think nether realm and dc should keep working together this is one of those games where we wait for it to come out and it meets our standards at most points it has good graphics great voice acting the action can be amazing at times and lackluster at others in my opinion it gets pretty repetative during the 4 hour story mode and the star lab missions can be downright frustrating at times with no real incentive to keep at them multiplayer is where this game shines it is great fun to take on your friends andd settle those lifelong debates like wwho would win between batman and aquaman all in all this is a good game but had just a few issues that kept it from being great i have this game before in xbox 360 but right now i have i xbox one and this game is only for xbox 360 ps3ps4 please make this game to xbox one i know there are people who like this game hardcore gamers thanks first off i loved injustice and traded my copy in to buy the ultimate edition i would recommend this edition over the original because you will receive all the dlc thats available for the game however being a dc comics fan for a majority of my life i have to wonder why they used batgirl and general zod quite honestly batgirl and batman are basically the same except for genders and superman and general zod are basically they same so why use them instead of adding something new and fresh like swamp thing or even killer croc even though i hate how many batman characters were put into this game the skins are incredible and were used from multiple different storylines throughout the dc universe such as blackest and dcs new 52 the campaign was good people who dont know the storyline would say incredible and was entertaining the campaign lasts around 56 hours but for a fighting game thats not too bad im hoping more future superhero fighting games are created like this i would highly recommend to all fighting game fans or superhero fans nice little bundle for those dark moments have not used it yet but feels good to have it around just in case i ordered storm bundles for our home and my family the bundles are a great value just in checking at a few local stores the lanterns alone cost almost as much as the entire bundle they are lightweight and easy to store as they are not big but they give off big light the little flashlights included really mark the way of course we tested everything out and they come with batteries that you can trust to get the job done i am not looking forward to having the power go out but when it does we are ready especially given how long of time it seems each time the power goes out for them to get it fixed i gave sets to elderly parents too as they are easy for them to hold and use one press of the button for bright light 2 quick presses for dimmer light and press and hold for the strobe light just press again to stop it the little flashing red light makes it easy to see in the dark changing the batteries is a bit of a challenge but everyone practiced a couple of times so when we need to in the dark it wont be an issue just turn the bottom off then match of the arrowed notches to get it back together best investment i could make i dont have to worry about dripping candles or fires with these we bought 2 bundles per household thinking about getting more no better deal anywhere for such quality at an affordable price will be getting more for family and friends you wont be sorry feel more secure and prepared having this storm bundle handy the lanterns are great they throw off alot of light really light up a room highly recommend them\\nthe glow in the dark flashlights are good but they do not glow like i would have expected one of the flash light defected and still waited for a replacement to send this one back the lantern gives off plenty of light for our need during power losses at home the flashlights also give of a good beam of light and they appear very durable the package came to us very quickly lantern very hard to open battery housing its just a large flash light\\nnot worthy of the name this lantern is small but has great light output that is comparable to larger ones already had the older model and the new model is just as great very bright lantern with a neat locator light great product have not tried the flashlight yet this game is a good game i have spent countless hours playing this game it is my overall 3rd favorite ds game of all time i highly advise casual gamers and hardcore gamers to buy this game a great game with improved graphics than that of the previous series however it tends to get dull after youve finished the storyline as the player is left with no incentive to keep playing this is my first pokemon game and i am completely hooked i would definitely recommend this to a friend or any gamer if you are thinking about getting a pokemon game then get it i was weary at first but after playing it for about an hour i was really happy i decided to buy it pokemon black is a very great pokemon game though it is the only one i have played i loved it if you have another pokemon game like diamond or pearl and if you have all the gym badges you can get on wifi or something and get your pokemon from another game onto black i love this game now in no way am i one of those pokefans that hates the games just because they are new ive played pokemon since blue and have loved all of the regions from the coastlines of johto to the island of sinnoh ive played them all and i loved the games ive clocked in at least 200 hours each unfortunately this came to an end when i played that unbearable mess that was white or maybe black version i dont remember because those games were in no sense fun they ruined the xp system gave us the worst pokemon up date ice cream and garbage bags  really but worst of all was the incredibly corny story line about some brain washed kid and pokemon being friends instead of tools which almost every pokemon is to all trainers except the protagonists in this case n this game was so bland that after i beat the elite four i turned off my ds and took it straight to bb to get 30 back i had no interest in the after game because the legendary trio was so lame it wasnt worth it to me i am going to buy b2 or w2 and hope that it is not quite this bad personally i have played all the pokemon games and have thoroughly enjoyed them however pokemon blacks sprites felt unoriginal and didnt have a pokemon feel to them and just seemed stupid or like they had run out of ideas at some points dont get me wrong this game is good despite my rating but as an avid pokemaniac i felt it didnt compare to the other games i really didnt like the new map and wasnt getting the nostalgic feel in each city as i had previously another point is the characters in this game are really annoying i mean you dont even have rivals anymore and your stupid friends really need to go away sometimes having played pokemon since the premiere of blue on the gameboy color i have enjoyed seeing the franchise develop over time in my opinion each game gets better and better and will only continue to do so the originals will always be special to those of us who grew up with them but its very obvious that the graphics and overall lasting appeal of pokemon black far surpass them\\n\\npros new places to explore and pokemon to catch while retaining the aspects of the original games that made them so famous theres always something to do even after playing through the basic storyline\\ncons i tend to play with the sound off because this is one area where all pokemon games continue to need improvement better background music please ok before you hate me i am in no way trashing this game it is still a good pokemon game but this has to be my least favorite version i have been playing pokemon ever since red version first came out and have played every version since i had been waiting a long time for new pokemon to appear and when i saw the announcement i was excited i got the game a little bit after it came out there were some things i loved that they added and some that i hated here is a list of my pros and cons\\n\\npros good story line\\nbeautiful cut scenes\\ncool environments\\npokemon move in battle\\nmechanics were greatly improved\\n\\ncons\\npokemon are very pixelated i know pokemon hasnt ever been about graphics but its hard to tell what your pokemon even looks like in battle this was the first thing i noticed whenever i started playing\\n\\npokemon are very uncreative some pokemon do look pretty cool but i noticed that a lot of them were based off of previous pokemon such as the one that looks like tauros in the first generation and the one that looks like luvdisc from the third generation\\n\\nstory is shorter compared to the others\\n\\nfew things to accomplish after you beat the story\\n\\nfor the first time since i have been playing pokemon i do not want to buy the next version in the series black and white 2 i see the same problems however i will return when x and y come out those look pretty awesome my favorite versions are still emerald version and heart gold version\\n\\nhope this has helped this game is great i have had it since summer 2012 and i still havent beat the game to its fullest it will definitely keep you playing this is one of the best games i have ever played i would reckomend this game to any one that likes pokemon the game is great you cant get over how weird team plamsa is and how they try to be good but there not i also love how you dont get any of the old pokemon in tell you have won agenist the final four pokemon is my childhood i played almost every game made i watched the anime until it got up to diamond and pearl trust me the anime is horrible here recently and i even have a plush pikachu  all nerdyness aside ahem pokemon black is a great way to either start out in the series as a newcomer or renew your faith in the ever popular franchise i like the game all the way through from the animation to the battles to the little details they added within the game i dont like the fact that rotation battles were not as frequent as it could have been but they were fun nontheless hopefully in black 2 they will have it more often also i have beaten the game today but they still have more story and pokemon to go it never ends as far as basic gameplay and story go this is the same as any other pokémon game your character receives a pokémon goes on an adventure to catch other pokémon and on the way makes friends battles other trainers and defeats enemies the character designs are interesting as always the locations are nice to look at and fun to explore and the new pokémon are welldesigned for the most part\\n\\nperhaps it was the way i built my team but i noticed that the gym battles were much more challenging than they had been in the last generation this was a nice change because strategy played much more of a part in these battles than luck or elemental advantages the poststoryline quests and regions are also larger and even after many hours of gameplay i havent yet done everything available to me\\n\\nthis game really makes good use of the ds connective capabilities the global link is an inventive and refreshing addition to gameplay the other online features are easier to use than ever making the game more social than previous installments were\\n\\none other vast improvement to the game is the soundtrack having played all generations except heartgoldsoulsilver i can honestly say that this game was the first one i can remember listening to all the way through the annoying beeping when a pokémon reaches low health has been integrated into its own song it is no longer repetitive and headacheinducing but pleasant\\n\\nwhile not my favorite of the franchise this game introduces great new features and improves on old ones guaranteeing a bright future for other pokémon games to come i have been playing this series since red  blue about 1314 years later i still am an active player of these games i had gotten this game as a gift the day it came out and personally didnt know what to think of it i chose the fire starter for once and began my journey in this new region to this day i have clocked in over 120 hours on my black version i have never loved a pokemon game as much as this the soundtrack is brilliant the characters are so unique and the bonus features such as the dream world and the battle subway are outstanding i highly reccomend this game to all pokemon lovers it is simply remarkable ok lets talk the pokemon are dumb looking the game is short pokemon heart gold soul silver had way more things to do like poklathon the pokemon can follow you you can go to a different region well the kanto which gives you more things to do and pokemon hg and ss are older than black and white and black and white are younger newer they left out so much stuff the story and game play are very good but the after story is not that great its boring and there is nothing to do the after story should be like soul silvers and heart golds this is one of my favorite games of all time only second to other pokemon games i enjoy the aspect of over 150 new pokemon and how the regions is so different from the others i have little to no complaints about this game i honestly can not wait for black 2 and white 2 to come out and i have expectations that it will be just as good if not better i also like the gts feature being improved from gen iv games overall pokemon black version is one my favorite games and i think almost anyone who likes pokemon will enjoy it whether you have been playing since red and blue or you have just started playing you will most likely enjoy it why cause pokemanz overall this game is one of the best in the pokemon series they could improve on graphics and maybe change the music but then again it does kinda have a catchy tune i played through it and had fun with some parts of the game it wasnt awful but ive never had this little fun with a pokémon game the characters were annoying and unlikable the battles were incredibly easy the storyline was dry it ended quickly and was incredibly unrewarding when finished its still an alright game and youll enjoy some parts but this game in no way lives up to any of the other titles im shocked nintendo is making a sequel to this horrid game just buy heartgold or play an older version youll have more fun the story is great your fighting team plasma it grips youthe game has all new pokemonits a really great gmane i highly reccomend it i usually love wrestling games but this is seriously one of the worst games ever made the gameplay is just horrible your punches will just go through people constant glitches that ruin the gameplay extremely slow cut scenes during game play that can still be interrupted by the computer player if you try to run a certain direction half the time it makes you run the other direction first and then there’s the ia reversal that just sucks the computer reverses way too much even on easy difficulty but you can’t reverse a reversal so gameplay is extremely frustrating and not fun anything you try to do will either miss or be reversed and the computer will just attack you during a cut scene that you can’t get out of terrible slow gameplay for the player with too much skill for the computer the only game i’ve played worse than this is 2k20… nice character creation some minor glitches lots of wrestlers good graphics i just dislike that you cant skip the cut scenes so it is very drug out the game is pretty good my career is a little more challenging than i though but overall it’s good i ordered wwe 2k19 online from gamestop that was guarantee to work and surprise surprise it didnt i love wwe 2k19 is the best game ever and number one wwe game of the world better then wwe 13 14 15 my 7 year old wwe fanatic likes it best out of all the wwe games and he has them all i bought it this month for the ps4 the quality is super good i feel like i’m actually watching an episode of raw and smack down on live tv love it great job wwe and i hope that they do some better stuff in 2k21 or 2k22 because i played 2k20 before and i didn’t really like it games good just sucks that if youre offline and wanna play 1v1 with a friendyou need to hava 2nd account and be connected to a wifi so 2nd player can start decent gameplay mechanics and a good array of minigames and objective driven game modes no online support as its 2 years old so that sucksespecially since 2k20 was worse by all accounts caw is great as usual and theres an interesting xp points system used to build experience would still like to be able ro do online play we have bought the storm preparedness bundle before and we absolutely appreciate it for how efficient it is and how inexpensive it is it is an extremely wonderful value for what it offers we take the lantern and the flashlights with us to third world countries and even in the us we know well be prepared when we will need light thanks rayovac i really like the led lights the lantern is not big but gives out a lot of nice white light this means it is easy to find a place to put it the 2 small flashlights also put out a lot of light and can be stored in a car glove compartment or pocket part of the small flashlight housing emits a faint glow after use so you can locate itoverall wonderful products of course rayovac batteries are one of the best made in the usa excellent life i was extremely disappointed to see the flashlights and lantern were made in china the lantern had no directions and it is supposed to have 3 settings strobe low and high the one i got only has strobe and high i presume high since i dont know what low looks like i would not have bought this package if i knew the nonconsumable items were made overseas great value lantern is nice and bright but i wish it was a little larger otherwise the package is perfect i had a friend recommend this lantern when i went on line to purchase i saw it was sold as a storm preparedness kit i bought two it was close to fathers day so i gave one to my son in law the light is perfect for a picinic table or remove the shade and hang by the hook great product will say buy on line i shopped locally it was almost twice as much lantern is very small was expecting something a bit bigger for a battery operated lantern flashlights are good for a pocket size light not sure yet how long a set of batteries will last it would be more upfront if you would give the product measurements instead of just the lumens most people dont know 1 lumen from the 240 lumen light you sold me the 240 sounds great but in reality it is not a great amount of light i put i would recommend just be aware of what you are buying when i first opened the package i was a little taken back by the size of the lantern i couldnt believe that something that small would be as bright as it is boy was i wrong that lantern is brighter than any propane one i have ever used plus it is compact lightweight and extremely durable the best thing i love about rayovac products is their fantastic customer service and i think it is great when a company stands behind their products like they do i am a rayovac customer for life ideal small lantern for power outages pleased with the purchase i mainly purchased this bundle for the lantern as i had read many positive reviews on various sites the lantern itself was smaller than i anticipated but it is definitely bright the fact that the globe easily comes off and allows it to be hung upside down is a plus getting the two extra flashlights which are pretty decent and all the batteries was just an added bonus why not 5 stars two reasons  the red led that is supposed to blink all the time to allow you to find the lantern in the dark does not work on the one i received not a big deal for me but that might be pretty important to someone else second i have not used it enough to test the claimed battery life\\nall in all though i would definitely recommend this bundle to a friend love this set the lantern which is tricky to open and insert batteries is wonderful we are going to really enjoy this come summer time and the little flash lights are small tho oh so powerful very good products for the money i bought two bundles and i consider it almost a steal at the price i paid thanks rayovac every thing you need for emergencys the lantern really bright and usefull led lighting technology has greatly improved over the last few years the lantern in this kit is a great example of that i bought this storm preparedness bundle primarily for the lantern the batteries and flashlights were a bonus the lantern is very bright and way better than any lantern ive ever used of course a coleman gas lantern is brighter but who wants to deal with all the negatives that go along with it the beauty of led lighting is efficiency leds consume something like 7 times less energy than conventional lighting when youre without electricity especially for a long period of time this is the lantern you want i even saw this lantern in a popular home improvement magazine where it was praised as being the best on the market by the way have you priced d batteries lately they aint cheap so the d batteries in this bundle must be considered when you realize what a great deal this is the flashlights appear to be made well and although there are much better flashlights on the market the included flashlights will get the job done and are just plain handy buy it you wont be disappointed  i like that it is small but give out a lot of light and use only 3 of d battery this is well made and puts out alot of light for a small lantern bought this storm preparedness bundle after super storm sandy since we live in a coastal area that frequently loses power was impressed with the quality of the lantern its brightness and portability very easy to install batteries and only uses 3 d cell rather than 4 or more that other lanterns require the two small flashlights included in this package are perfect for your pocket or purse plus they are quite attractive lime green and pink when you consider this package also included a package of4 d cell batteries it was a very good deal however even though it says 300 lumens on the packaging you will be delivered one that says 240 lumens i have tried twice but the lantern provide plenty of light it will light up a good sized room vs a flashlight i am hard to please but i am satisfied i am ordering another one this is a small lantern but powerful i bought the lantern that uses 8 d batteries this lantern is almost as powerful uses less batteries and last longer its also small i bought 4 kept two and gave two as gifts wort the cost i loved the bundle so much i had to get a second the lantern is very bright and has different hanging options i also enjoy the smaller flashlights that glow in the dark it is well worth the money after hurrican sandy i knew i need some additonal lighting for when the electric was off i purchased one lantern when i saw how much light it delivered i purchased several more for my family lots of light for a little lantern all ready for the next storm best game in the series too bad i can’t say the same for 2k20 a gamer’s life goes on the physics are still off youl go to grapple your opponent and sometimes you are facing the completely wrong directionsometimes attacks dont register at all connection lag online has always been a problem with these games its the servers slowing down most of the time not the isp as most players have the fastest available internet connections while regular roster characters move more realistically the created characters still move two times faster so by the time youv thrown a punch as a regular roster character the created character you are fighting will have ran laps around the ring and still beat you to the punch \\r\\n\\r\\ngraphics feel like they have gotten considerably worse than previous wwe games the characters lack polish and detail many of the created versions in the community look much better and more detailed overall happy but bought the deluxe edition and didnt have the dlc codes average game but im not as much of a wrestling fan as i used to be this video game has captured my sons attention for hours  this was a great purchase for him and me it’s awesome i loved the game i’m pretty anyone even those who aren’t fans of wrestling will love it ive been a wrestling fan since wcw and ecw mid 90s so i like to play wrestling games and collect it but here comes the plain and no mercy wwe 2k14 in my personal opinion are best of the best wrestling games ive ever played i hope one day 2k brings back showcase of most popular wrestlers of all time in wrestling games again  a fun game that lets you experience wrestling to the fullest i had a great time with the game it’s really more than five stars especially the wwe showcase and mycareer mode big upgrade from 2k18 the people actually talk i love the game and 100 percent sure that you will too went in looking to get wwe 2k20 but everything id heard that day said it was a dumpster fire picked up 2k19 instead and have not been disappointed fun game with several lol moments in the career mode showcase with daniel bryan is excellent for fans pokemon black and pokemon white are awesome continueations from the original pokemon games pokemon is a rpg that is set in the whole new unova region featuring new pokemon animations new pokemon and a whole new emersive story that takes place in a whole new world with thew gyms new bad guys team plasma and entirely new ways to battle featuring the brand new triple battle and rotation battle also new to the pokemon games is the pokemon musical in nimbasa city where you can put your pokemon in the spotlight and have them dance with interactable props to help you score high with the audience also with wireless communications you may play with friends to see who is better at musicals pokemon black and white also feature he brand new battle subway feature where just like the battle tower in previous games the battle subway lets you team up with the opposite gender of your charecter you may battle through multiple trainers for battle points to get special items from potions to rare candy even though the 3d graphics are a bit shabby i give this game 2 thumbs up although the earlier generations specifically 13 were always the high point of pokemon this newest installment enhances so many things adding new items for strategies new moves for setting up sweeps quiver dance on volcarona and allaround very useful pokemon in competitive battling although the main story is not too deep it doesnt have to be you play this game to train up a team and defeat your friends the wifi battling experience was also greatly improved in this game much better than pbr and trading is done right now by being able to select pokemon from your pc and negotiations online and if you need experience to train you can get plenty of experience by defeating audino in rustling grass they have the highest exp giveaway ratio of pokemon in the game and good also if you for some reason need hp evs but if youve finished ev training its a great way to speed up the leveling process ive gotten two pokemon to lv100 in just a few hours of concentrated play overall a great game this game was definitely my favorite pokemon game to date the plot was absolutely amazing a plot in a pokemon game and the main game ending was a real shocker the gym leaders were fun and some of the new pokemon were really awesome the postgame kept me playing a lot as well however i thought the game was too easy and also too straightforward i never had to try a ton of times to beat a gym leader and i got through the pokemon league on my 2nd try also some of the pokemon were just ripoffs of old pokemon that didnt make an appearance in the main game like woobat and zubat roggenrolla and geodude but it is still an amazing game and i think that it would be a great addition to anyones gaming collection i like this game alot but ive played just about every pokemon game and can say that this is the worse of them all first of all its too easy each starter is suppose to correspond with the 3 difficulty levelseasymediumhard trainers in each city use just about the same few pathetic pokemon and wild pokemon repeat too much as appose to the other games where the pokemon repeated but not to such an annoying point the game also provides a ridiculous amount of healing sourcesitems and it constantly reminds you what pokemon types the gyms usethats unnecessary second its just completely boring there are no minigames to play like in dp the soundtrack is nothing new and over half the pokemon themselves are just quickly made and uglyim not the only one who thinks so overall bw seem to have been made for people who just discovered that pokemon exists i only recommend this to noobies people who just want to play with new pokemon or people who want to be prepared for bw 2 which hopefully are like dp other than that id have to say get diamond or pearl because they have none of these problems first you always need to talk to everyone so u can see if they have info because you can get tips that help you out in a battlesconed off always use moves the do damage the moves that lower stats are just stupid and i think that beating the final 4 a second time was kind f hard becuse they up to level 75s and 78s and i coudlent get my ppkenmon up to that so i just restarted and i do not recomed this to hardcore players this is actually the first pokemon game ive played in a while ever since playing pokemon diamond and most of the gba games which were good but the story often got either frustrating and or respetive for me im pretty happy i bought pokemon black to me its the best out of any pokemon game ive played but there are some equally frustrating things about this one cons one of the biggest problems im having with this game and the reason why i only gave it a average rating was because the new pokemon are a nightmare not only are they not creative such as wubat who had me laughing for hours because it was such a ripoff of zubat but they are really weak i found myself having real difficulties with beating anything after my 4th gym badge i mean seriously my starter pokemon tepig who is said to be the best out of the two other starters is in 2nd evolution level 35 and is losing to wild animals of level 22 whats up with that which believe me is sooo frustrating and for some reason they decided to pixelate the pokemon so the pokemon look like they did in the gameboy advance games which isnt horrible but they just leave you thinking why pros the pros of the game is that the game settings are amazing and unlike the pokemon are so creative and just so fun to explore the game also has lots of opportunities to help your pokemon advance levels which would of been great except the pokemon are really weak so it doesnt help much also i love that they didnt make the gym leaders ridiculously hard like they always do in the previous pokemon games in conclusion the settings and places in this game is great the pokemon not so great so if you can stand always running back in forth from forest to health center throughout the game then i would recommend it but if you get frustrated with things like that like i do you might want to wait and buy pokemon black 2 which im totally getting because they are bringing back the the good pokemon generations as well as the new ones in this game and hopefully with all the new settings and places like this one to be honest i was expecting more from this game but i find myself enjoying the older versions more and finding myself putting this game away to collect dust whenever i pick it up now i hesitate on even playing it the pokemon are beginning to look too weird to me and i was dissapointed for the ending but the end credits music was kinda cool p thanks to this game i realized that i can enjoy only the older versions because that was what i truly enjoyed when i was a kid i cannot feel that enjoyment coming out of these newer games dont get me wrong there are some cool wifi and wireless stuff on these new games but they are not meant for pokemon im beginning to wonder if this is the last pokemon generation that nintendos making the pokemon series has traveled far but i think its time to hang it up and finally be done with catching em all i love the game its so fun and it looks so 3d i wish i got genesect to but i will have to wait i beat the game in a week it was so fun when i first got this game i almost actually didnt want to play it in fear of it ruining all my past pokemon experiences though as soon as i started playing it i realized what they did with the game is actually pretty awesome i understand that its hard naming and creating pokemon so the originals will obviously be the best but besides that it did very well they have rotation battles two versus two battles which take place either by running into two opponents at once or running in the tall dark green grass the world is more modernized and it really is a step up into the pokemon series future pokemon black is gamefreaks latest pokemon game in the storied franchise the games starts out when your friends come over and you choose your pokemon and they teach you about battling you chose either snivy a grass type oshawatt a water type or tepig a fire type you are in the unova region the largest region in all of pokemon there are many unique types of pokemon in the region there are also lots of legandaries  from reshiram and zekerom to keyreum and tornadas the main bad guys in the black and white series are team plasma they dont like people owning pokemon so they try to separate them and the elite four is back and tougher than ever the types are ghost psychic fighting and dark there are also lots of post game activites and after the game has ended other pokemon from other egions pop up from onix and feebas to crogunk and tangela so overall is another awesome game from the pokemon franchise and is highly recommended for any pokemon fan good brightnessgood quality productgood valueused for gifts the latern works better than expected its really bright for the price after having the scare of my life with hurricane sandy i ordered the storm preparedness bundle so i would be ready for the next weather disaster\\n\\ni was pleasantly surprised that the 2 small flash lights in the bundle have pretty strong beams for their size the lantern also has a nice strong beam that i hope will last if i should need to use it in the future i feel that even though the overall package is a good value i think the lantern is overpriced\\ni am concerned that the constant blinking light will cause the batteries to prematurely discharge the lantern and flashlights are made very well and also has a powerfull light the price for it all cant be beat the only problem was no instructions of how to put the batteries in the lantern i had to scout this site and lo and behold i found the instructions by accident\\nyou twist the bottom offput the batteries in then line up the red and white arrows to twist the bottom back on you must use some pushing down force when putting this lid back on\\noh the lantern takes only 3 batteries so you get one extra\\ntoo bad we didnt have this when we were hit with hurricane sandy\\ni gave it 4 stars because no instructions were enclosed just as advertized bright enough  no frills\\njust light i like some of the new moves and things you can do in this game love wwe 2k19 all my favorite  wrestlers game play is great but it just so i could have something that could just quickly play real fast good game overall i like how the game plays and the story is great as well i wish they picked a better menu color then white but its a little nit pick on it sides that games fun difficult though the online could be better still having the very delayed netcode but what can you do it was good step forward but 2k20 negated all of that the people at the store are very nice but the game did not work and i got it pre owned its just like every other wwe game just added new people yeah a great wrestling game it could add some more wrestlers like from wcw nwo and others from the 80s and 90s got it for a friend and he was like its extremely terrible he did not think the game could get any worse well it did just very choppy game play  you repeat a lot of moves over and over overall excellent game most people have been saying how the new pokemon are pathetic but i disagree at first i thought that they looked pretty stupid and would be pretty bad for a team but i quickly learned to love them as i discovered more i didnt know were in the game i agree nintendo could have come up with better but overall they did a great job i have some new favorites from this game but for gameplay also great true its the same old point of every pokemon game catch all the pokemon and fill out the pokedex and become champion but with all the new things they added new moves abilities and battle styles it sure turned that into a pretty neat twist and the way i play pokemon games the game could last me forever but if your younger or getting it for a younger kid it would end pretty quickly after the game is complete now for the downsides personally i hated how they didnt add any of the new pokemon from previous generations if this is your first pokemon experience its all good and wont effect you but for those who have played it before will be disappointed and after completing the game there isnt much to do after except for battling no more story or anything but what i did like is how they changed the wifi connections with the game with previous pokemon ds titles i couldnt connect the game to wifi because of the way the wifi was locked to specific connections but they updated it so now it can connect to my wifi and is able to connect with all connections so now im able to use all the wifi features in the game which are great so my overall conclusion is great game i love what they added and some of the things they took out with 3d graphics a lengthy game neat new pokemon story line and awesome new features i say nintendo could have done a lot better but still made something good and worthy to get honestly this was the most amazing pokemon game ever ive been playing pokemon forever because they are so addicting and fun but the story line to this one and the plot was amazing but for future games i would love if they had the idea of going to other regions like in goldsilverheartgoldsoulsilver because that was a great game i love the online trading center it makes your life so much easier when it comes to collecting all the pokemon after the game is done the pokemon could be a little more original but who cares your first goal is to conquer all the gyms and then think about the details of pokemon later this game was simply great but i do wish i got white instead because zekrom is one of the coolest pokemon ever i just got the game and needless to say im rather disappointed they should have left well enough alone the graphics are ok but i would rather have less motion in the battles than the pixelated pokemon in them now im not a huge fan of moving away from the basic 2d gameplay pokemon has always been many of the pokemon are basically remakes of previous ones like woobat seriously it even rhymes with zubat they need to get some more creativity in it next time they should have gone ahead and remade ruby and sapphire before making a whole new game if they knew it would turn out like this though the story has been rather good so far and the music for the team plasma battles is awesome i bought this game thinking it would be better than diamond or pearl what was nintendo doing the past 4 years the pokemon were stupid there was no creativity they should just make a remake of firered or some older pokemon game or something i would not even recommend this to a 4 year old please nintendo while im trying to keep my manners make a better game  fun game first if you never played pokemon before i would sugest terrible at spelling pokemon platnim pearl or diamond second best grafics ever third do not listen to the bad comments pleasssssss i got this game recently i started playing it and found that is was hard to quit its great with all the new pokemon and the new experience in the unova region new things new everything this game was aweful i bought it a while ago when white and black first came out i was pumped to play a new pokemon game simply because they are a good way to get entertainment this game sucks horribly they seriously brought the graphics back to a way worse than playing blue or red dont waste your money if your going to buy a pokemon game get one of the other ones not black or white the game is great but it keeps repeating same old themes of past pokemon games which is sort of boring but anyways the pokemon move in battle and its fun pokemon once again has made a new generation with new pokemon new places to explore and new gym leaders and other opponents this is game is a good game that should last a long time because you could try to aim towards new pokemon to catch and train including the four other regions there are now a total of 649 pokemon you can try to get rasing pokemon is fun but the game and story plot are the same as usual still a decent game both games are the same and have minor diffrences so it doesnt really matter which one you get pokemon black version is the companion to pokemon white version the fifth generation pokemon games this fifth generation game really delivers the standard pokemon experience as i said this game is geared toward novice players who are new to the series some of the features that can show you this can also really enhance the gameplay for anyone the text moves faster the pokemon attack faster and some more things to really enhance the gameplay its the little things that make the game more fun but perhaps the biggest thing to make the game easy to pick up and play for anyone is that pokemon gain so much more experience per battle that it makes levelgrinding obsolete which is a good feeling switch training is also still very effective for training many pokemon at once if a pokemon has a status ailment it will show it on the pokemons body like if the pokemon is asleep the sprites eyes close to show that its asleep parts of the game stray away from that isometric viewpoint that many pokemon veterans are used to and make use of full 3d the best examples of this are on the skyarrow bridge and in castelia city that alone makes the game so much more enjoyable the music is overall not that great but there are some songs in the game that are so good they make up for all the bad ones the following isnt anything new to me but i think the female sprite is just hot what can i say pokemon girls are hot pokemon black is a great game good graphics decent music and the small things have been improved that just make the game more enjoyable it may be a bit too easy for a pokemon veteran but this game is still very easy to recommend to anyone whether you are a pokemon veteran or new to the series buy it now love the game i appreciate the easy way to order the cards so i dont have to leave my house thank you game stop the gear stats could been a little better but otherwise a great choice cant farm gear like this so youre forced to buy it or roll seasonal loot boxes and hope you get what you need its cool and gave me the stuff it said i have been playing for 10 years now and always bought wizard101 cards from gamestop they are very reliable retailer and if there is a problem with the order they can help you resolve it i bought to see what the stats were good if you are into pets but not so great compared to other bundles for pve great way just to get full energy gear besides the wand if you dont want to go through packs my daughter loves this doll house she plays with it non stop definitley worth the price pretty doll house and the fact it closes after play time is a great function so it keeps her room tidy hands down the best dollhouse my daughter couldn’t be happier arrived on time as promised christmas eve and my 4 year old granddaughter was delighted i used to work in the toy industry at coleco as a product manager in this category and can say it was a bargain nicely made piece magic added with lights and imagination abound bought this to have at my house for my 5 year old granddaughter  since it’s going to be in my living room i decided to paint it a different color   \\r\\nturned out beautiful  also added remote controlled battery lights to the ceilings makes it look very real especially when the front is closed while putting together this dollhouse together there was many inconsistencies with the pieces the walls did not line up properly and the doors did not screw in because the cut outs did not line up properly quality control is nonexistent the cost of this house does not match the quality one would expect i bought this doll house as a birthday gift for my 5 year old daughter she loves it and play a lot with it it’s a beautiful doll house i love the quality the size the color it’s a doll house that any girl would love to have it’s worth the price\\r\\nit takes time to put it together but if you download the app that it’s recommended bild it’ll be so much easier to follow the steps and faster to get it done the doll house is beautiful my granddaughter loves it not to difficult to put together my son said they should print the instructions in color when i purchased this dollhouse it was described as being heirloom quality which it certainly is not  when i opened the box the laminate on some of the pressboard pieces was already peeling the pillows all had visible holes and the piano came leaking battery acid like crazy and had to be tossed out  many of the plastic pieces dont line up well with the construction of the house and have to be constantly fiddled with to stay in place  the house itself as well as the contents looks a lot cheaper in person and isnt really the quality i was expecting for such an expensive purchase  that being said it is heavy and sturdy  the moving windows and doors are fun for my six year old though i gathered she wasnt terribly impressed overall doll houses are very nice and seem to be well made they took a little while to put together  i bought 2 but worth it because the granddaughters love them this house is beautiful and the app to assemble made it so much easier there was one step that was particularly confusing but overall we are extremely pleased with this product good game but online mode should be free fun to play when you want to take anger out on someone but you can’t so you play wwe 2k extreme rules haven’t played a wwe game since 2015 and 2k19 really brought back those memories great game but i feel like they can still do better so let’s see how 2k20 gonna be really good game especially for me i love wwe gamestop has everything thanks for the awesome game the game is glitchy and kinda slow paced and the computer  players get these speed boosts from out of no where its a great game in my opinion the bed wwe 2k game ive played improved mechanics and easy to pick up for a novice player i better then the last one female got more things to do in this game i finally bought this at the 20 buck price because i feel like thats what these titles are really worth now the match expansion is cool creating a mitb is neat too albeit very lite form of it but the gameplay is still the same with little really added to it the paybacks are okay but not really much of a momentum shift change  the daniel bryan showcase is like playing wrestling bopit the entire match is just do the certain objective until a cutscene happens that leaves you at a disadvantage or just finishes the match for you 2k still needs work on these it is a fun game pretty much like the other wrestling games the cutomization is awesome exciting game when you choose the right difficulty too easy and youre always ahead which makes it boring but qhen youre realky battling with other cars it becomes and extremely exciting game could have have been a lot better with some aditional commentary especially when it comes to players driving skills and progress to make it a lot more realistic not what i expected i enjoy the forza games because i like designing my own paint schemes i like the game completed it very fast\\nnow when i play it i trade a lot like crazy\\nloved it now using it for trading thanks nintendo i love pokemon and i love the game its fun all my friends like to play my game i think pokemon games are addicting i got the pokemon black dsi bundle and i was very pleased with it it was a little over priced because i dont see charging over 150 for a hand held system as even reasonable but i digress the game play is fun and the use of the cgear makes it where you have to go online to do alot of things but its still a good game the online how ever is not appealing in the least while the use of wifi trading from around the world is kool you often come across 5yr olds with all rare and shiny pokemon who taunt you in the trade center or you incounter those who only want rare pokemon and will give you a very common pokemon in return ex they want to give you a magikarp for your reshiram i still love the game as ive grown up in the pokemon era i totally recommend this game to anyone who loves pokemon as i am 18 yrs old and in college and i still play pokemon pokemon black is a wonderful game although it is very addicting once you start playing you just cant stop i recommend this game for all ages of gamers choose your pokemon wisely because the pokemon in the unova region are very tough this game kept me busy for about 4 hours a day this is a fantastic and great game to play i can not stress how much i love this game the world map of the game got smaller and the gym battle are easymaking this pokemon series kinda of nooby it good game but it wasnt hardcore like ruby or pearl this is a great game for all ages i am in highschool but i fell in love with the pokemon series forever ago it came out the year i was born and ever since nothing short of excellence was expected the 5th gen game does not dissappoint pokemon black version is a very challenging game the graphics are really good but the bad thing is that cant trade back and fourth to other games like pokemon heart gold if you had to pick a pokemon game than this game i would recommend this game because it gives you lots of great new pokemon and still adds the classic pokemon too i got this game a few months ago and its a great gameget this if you like pokemon its a great game over all it really nice but at the end of the day its just not pokemon to me pokemon is pikachu gyms and team whatevers that dont have some stupid outfits rip team rocket i was all pumped for this game i thought it was awesome for like three days but then it hit me why am i playing this this game just didnt have that excitement that sapphire ruby emerald platinum pearl diamond gold silver red blue and green gave me this is my opinion feel free to get it and enjoy it but im just saying great game most of all they increased game difficulty d fabulous fabulous doll house even the kids are raving about the attention to detail they love it and have filled it with at least 20 barbie dolls i’d buy it again in a heartbeat this dolls house is amazing  we bought it for our 4 year old and she absolutely loves it she is going to be playing with it for years to come  excellent quality  large colorful and comes with so much furniture  i feel its worth a lot more than the price we paid  awesome it’s big and beautiful but we are not the most handy people i’m six months pregnant so it took three of us instead of two and definitely took more than 2 12 hours we are all glad it’s finally over my daughter is certainly happy with her new doll house after months of searching i decided that this 16 scale house for barbie was the best deal  originally i wanted the  real good toys estate house or  real good toys victorian townhouse which are beautiful but 3 x more expensive   this grand anniversary dollhouse had everything that i needed but the color scheme was not working for me so i took the time to spray paint the house a pale blue and kept the white trim i painted the red doors white to offset the light blue  i also hung wreaths on the windows and doorway and put a topiary tree near the door  the result was gorgeous  i modified the floor plan in the interior of the home to add more room to the dollhouse  it turned out wonderfully\\r\\n\\r\\npros  beautiful workmanship very good quality and sturdy   even though i wallpapered and repainted the inside of the house i did admire the original artwork  i had ordered some custom furniture on etsy that didnt match the original artwork inside  love the working lights on the outside 2  coach lamps as well as the working windows  the wood is sturdy and beautiful  love that the house is similar to english dollhouses in the sense that it opens in the front  the musical piano is especially nice  this is a good pinterest project that  you can customize for your child or yourself  i have received many compliments on the way i painted and changed the color scheme of the house  \\r\\n\\r\\ncons the biggest con is the color scheme  the colors are too loud and garish for my taste though i understand that many real life victorian homes are painted  in similar colors  however for a dollhouse the colors are overwhelming the house is time consuming to build but when finished it is worth it  also i was under the impression that the back of the dollhouse was painted due to an advertisement i saw f  i was disappointed that the dollhouse wasnt decorated in the back of the house like it was portrayed in a neiman marcus christmas ad   also the doll house only has a little bit of siding  out of the 6 panels only two panels had siding  however  like i said above once built and painted the dollhouse is exquisite magnifique belle finitions solide bonne qualité its truely an amazing doll house once its put together it takes a lot of patience and time but its worth it gave this to my daughter for an early birthday present and she absolutely loves it its so big theres no way we could hide it from her the colors are so rich and furniture in fabulous detail what a great addition to have the working outdoor lights and the musical piano use the bilt app and assembly will be very smooth i cant say enough good things about this product i put together this dollhouse for my nieces age 2  4 this is the first big item i have ever put together and it was very easy i recommend using a drill for the screws it took me a couple hours to put together and all worth it the dollhouse is very sturdy and will be able to handle wear and tear for years the furniture is so nice also has decorative interior and very fitting in every room i loved the velvet pillows and musical piano it also has lanterns on the outside that light up talk about cute i cant wait to see their faces when i give it to them this dollhouse is so cute and has such a fun layout it is big and has lots of fun rooms the furniture that comes with the dollhouse is so nice and great quality it is a little tedious to put together because there are so many parts but all the little parts truly make the dollhouse i put the house together by myself and it took me a little over 3 hours make sure you use the bilt app as well as the directions to put it together this dollhouse will be hours of fun for the kids and will last for such a long time i would definitely recommend this dollhouse your child will love it this dollhouse is a beautiful the rooms are vibrant and cheerful there are so many details that make this such a fun dollhouse from the exterior lights the doors and windows that open and all the adorable furniture this is a house id like to live in myself our kids are having such fun playing house i love that the size of the house is great for toddlers on up to elementary kids we will enjoy this house for many years we used the bilt app and found it extremely helpful with the assembly you definitely want to use that i enjoy most wwe games but with the constant changing and addingremoving various things in creation modes it gets aggravating wrestling has been apart of the gaming world for years and as time goes by it just keeps getting better ive played it for a while now and im loving it everything is still the same and i see theyre bring back some other features like create a move and title going the game is fun because it gives you a chance to unlock other characters and ring arenas plus theres dlc content you can download like exclusive characters but i think if you go through the game you should be able to unlock the characters without the buying the dlc however the gameplay is excellent and the graphics is looking good since the ps1 days and its been a long time i do have my nics and pics about the game but its nothing serve and i enjoy playing the game especially when i go online and thats when things gets really interesting online with this game is really intense especially when youre up against a wrestling fan and it is amazing overall this is a game i reccomend for everyone whether youre new to game or an experience gamer pop this bad boy in and bodyslamming your opponent also the the ladies loves it so it can be fun for couples as well its pretty good game just still playing it though doesnt cheat as much as wwe2k18 did i really love the manager walks out with the superstar wish though you could walk down with one than 1 belt im still learning new things overall i love the game keep up the good work 2k nostalgia factors for me saying i come from the attitude era pretty fun game just wish it wasn’t made by 2k and their vc grabs at people it is fun and a pretty addictive game for wrestling fans it takes a minute to get used to the timing of pushing the buttons but once you get it it is a lot of fun to play this is an awesome game old and new wrestlers i recommend anyone who is a wrestling fan this game is a piece of junk cant even make a decent doink the clown or demolition graphics are ok but thats it yuck there’s no real technique you have limited reversals and that’s not realistic this hand has a lot of potential and opportunities to improve i used to love wresting games now i don’t think i’ll ever purchase another one this is by far the best wrestling game in the 2k series and the best wwe game in history why buy the superstars why not just add in the regular game 2kplease 2k white was great i purchased a preowned one of these and it didnt work how in the heck did the previous owner break a ds cartridge also arent the employees supposed to check trade in games yes they are but white was good so im assuming black is good too the pokemon series has kept to its roots for more than ten years remaining a rockpaperscissortype rpg with this very basic format comes with additional features graphical improvements and unfortunately some negative things as well\\n\\ndont mistake me for saying this game is bad  it is indeed a superb game i would like to cover each aspect of the game\\n\\nwe start off with the gameplay it seems rather simplistic water beats fire fire beats grass and so forth each pokemon you own can learn up to four moves and moves are divided into physical special and stat moves are also divided into 17 elemental types much like the pokemon with these moves you are to lower the opponent pokemons hp to 0 certain moves known as hms are needed to access areas you couldnt access prior fortunately for those who dont like using hm slaves they are not required to proceed in the storyline save for one instance\\n\\nas for the story you are a boygirl of around 1416 years of age with two friends cheren and bianca the three of you are about to receive your first pokemon from professor juniperwho also happens to be the first female professor in the mainstream pokemon games with your pokemon you will be setting out not only on a journey to defeat the pokemon league and claim the title of champion but to be acknowledged as fullfledged adults which makes sense considering your characters age along your journey you will be encountering team plasma an organization striving to separate pokemon from humans you of course are against this ludicrous ideal and things become more serious\\n\\nas for graphics 2d sprites dont really go well with 3d environments but its a nice step towards making 3d handheld games more detailed\\n\\nthere are a few additional features like the pokemon musical and the cgear but ill leave you to try those yourself these add to the lasting appeal but because the unova region is so linearremoving a lot of backtracking unlike other pokemon games it still feels a little neutered\\n\\noverall this is a great pokemon game like all other mainstream pokemon games and im sure you will enjoy this game\\n\\nif youre in doubt though try giving it a rental first this game is amazing it has a great story line with two rivals which is a change also the graphics are the best ever everything looks more smooth when you are walking around and while in battles the pokemon move around in place which is a great featuremy only complaint is there was too much of a difficulty gap between the last gym leader and the elite four but i was still able to get through is in a couple tries this is the best pokemon game ever ive been a fan ever since fire red ive had fire redsapphiredimondpearlplatinumheart goldsoul silver blackand i hope to soon have pokemon white the elite four is different than the other games considering you get to chose the order you also get 2 friendsrivals one helps you and the other just tries to beat you its basically the same but with over 150 new pokemon its the best pokemon game everif you like pokemon youll love this game if it aint broke dont fix it game freak sure took that into account when developing this and we can all be glad they did its classic pokemon you really cant call it anything else this game had something different about it yes two rivals are strange but the thing that got me was the difficulty to level up your pokemon if you catch lillipup there is a high chance that it will become your strongest not your starter weird but an awesome game anyhow it was an okay game i was expecting more really i have been a follower of pokemon since blue version now i dont want to be one of those old people that just thing all new pokemon suck cause that isnt true i must say though that they did take out some fetures that i liked from soulsilver  heartgold the pokemon walking next to you the pokewalker and other things that i cant think of off the top of my head now the story line was okay it was a little different than the original pokemon games but still the same all in all there are the bad guys that you gotta stop and then there is the eliete four that you have to beat in order to become the best it wouldnt be my first pokemon game to recomend to a friend but it is a good game for anyone who has been following pokemon for awhile just dont be dissapointed when you see that all things arent the way you would have liked them to be ive been playing pokemon games for the past my rough guess 15 years and was a huge fan of pokemon blue version still am that said pokemon has come a long way graphically but not so far for storylines this game stuck more with the traditional game play style than say pokemon ranger which i liked the story wasnt bad either all in all i enjoyed playing this game i bought this game used from gamestop since i love pokemon i wanted to try it so i got this in the mail and got it out put it in my ds lite and went to start it from the save file and it froze every time i went to it so i started a new one and it worked i reccomend this game to anyone this was probably the best pokemon game nintendo has ever made the graphics were great the storyline was awesome and the battle style was amazing nintendo should definitely make more pokemon games like this one pros this is a sturdy nice quality dollhouse that will should last for many years the working porch lights and piano are a cool addition to a traditional toy i also love the velvet upholstery on the furniture also love that you can close the house and hide the mess when not in use the bilt app for assembly is a must  it made assembly much easier than traditional paper instructions it accurately estimated the assembly time at 25 hours cons we had a piece that was produced incorrectly that caused a major delay in setting it up piece 40  the upper balcony  was backwards it is a rectangle with 3 notched corners that attach to 3 columns pcs 38 and 39 to make the piece fit i had to turn it upside down so that the ceiling fan was the floor of the upper balcony its a rectangle so you cant just turn it it only fits one way  the stickers that are the floor and ceiling were on the wrong side of the board we worked around this by taking 38 apart and reversing the balcony railings this piece is already nailedglued together for you but this prevented us from attaching the blue spandrels as the holes where they would be attached were on the wrong side then so those are missing on the finished product but the kids will never notice the house is already so colorful and busy that its not a big deal that they dont fit there are so many options and a huge roster to choose from great game family friendly calls for a great time super customizable dlc’s download additional characters and more as someone whos used to playing the older wrestling games im not a fan of how this the game feels the wrestlers movement is slow and it sometimes it seems sluggish the grappling system seems slow the reversal system is bad the idea of exact timing and requiring stamina make reversing moves difficult when compared to previous wwe games and the only time a message pops up for your tutorial is after youve already done something which means you have to discover the game controls for yourself that makes performing more advanced moves and features difficult i found that career mode  my player mode is also lacking the storyline seems boring and the only choices that you make in the game are insignificant in older wrestling games for season mode you could decide whether to be a singles competitor or a tag team competitor or who you wanted to form an alliance with but for this game you just create a generic character and get put through a predictable storyline i guess im a fan of a more openworld style career mode which this game is not the only redeemable part of this game is its roster it has wrestlers from the past and present it is very old in graphics it’s a terrible game it’s one of the worst i have ever experienced it has finally happened and wwe 2k has made a game with a decent story for my career mode it’s honestly a cheesy storyline that made me laugh a few times but still better than what you’ll watch in the wwe nowadays with more legends than i remember you’ll find yourself enjoying this game even if youre not a fan of the current wwe there is a grind to unlock everything though unless you just want to pay to unlock everything really am glad about the story mode though that alone made this purchase for me enjoyable few glitches but nothing game breaking would recommend my son loves it as for me not so much the move lists are just blatantly dumb you have to be in a certain spot to do the said move tag team is a waste when you click to tag your partner you end up climbing the ropes instead still haven’t figured out how to use the player you created in a reg one on one the game has a lot of flaws but if you have kids they’ll like it the wwe 2k series has had a rocky road as of late from game busting glitches to slimming down game modes the series have had fans wondering if the franchise should take a year or two off but with wwe 2k19 the series has come back as one of the best wrestling titles in the last 5 years a huge roster improved graphics fixed glitches and the return of showcase with none other than daniel bryan’s historic wrestlemania 30 storyline and his ultimate return from a near career ending injury makes this 2k version a must buy same as previous yrs better graphics and smoother gameplay steep learning curve as the game doesn’t really do a good job of teaching you how to play  but gets to be more fun albeit repetitive as you figure out the controls its ok story mode is back which was refreshing still not worth new price pokemon company plz do better next game okay its fun but for a while but the story is short they should make it a lot longer i beat it in 2 days its addicting but when you get to the end it gets boring really fasteverything is fun but is wish it would be a lot longerwere it takes a year to finish it fun worlds new game play elimits and fun puzzils and gameplay new tips of battles and new pokemon good online amzing lots to do its a long keeps u bizzy lots of good gameplay and 3d worlds its realy good i love it ps good story and so funny parts easter eggs and black city if u git this one it fills differt and new ps its have new music good parts i love online its crazy adding difert fill than the other pokemon games if ur bord with the same old pokemon give this a try first off reviews are saying you beat the game in a few days true but if you play the game correctly complete your pokédex go to the dream world train more pokémon possibly battle or trade on the gts and even more then there is plenty of more fun bound to happen on this game  the storyline is pretty neat its a little predictable but i loved it anyway the graphics are awesome especially when completing the story and seeing the older generation pokémon using moves against others i recommended this to many of my friends and they all did the same this game was really fun for like a month but then i beat alder the pokemon champion like 13 times and the game just was not fun anymore get it the graphics are great if you like pokemonthis is a game for you it has good graphics but so short beat it in five days and there is just nothing to dowell i quit pokemon a few months ago anyway its just well okay at first i thought it was the best game ever because all the other games ive played are kinda dumb p but then i watched gameplay videos from other games and i was like well compared to the other games black is like that dumb silly bandz game the story was kinda short too i finished it in 2 days but other people finish it quicker somehow im also depressed that i didnt get white instead because of 1 version exclusive pokemon and 2 the white forest i would recomend this to a friend though its a pretty good game and the ratings are for comparing it to other pokemon games not your average boring insanely unrealistic games this is my favorite pokemon game because of all the new features that are in the game if your a pokemon fan or someone who wants a lot of extra content out of a ds game you cant go wrong with pokemon black pokemon black is a really cool game the graphics are good and they have plenty of new pokemon to collect this game is only fun if you hadnt played all the other pokemon games before it battles are fun but there are just to many weird looking pokemon the disk is so scratched up that the xbox cant even read it why do you sell games that are unusable \\r\\ni am very disappointed with this experience we love this game to play together as a family kids love it the most the game is fine just wasnts the one i came in for this game is like the one on the phone love this game and works perfectly just as fun as the tablet version plants vs zombies has always been a go to on any platform i highly recommend fun and addicting game but ends too soon needs more levels always played this to death on the computer and now i can do that on console another classic with multiplayer no less cant beat it kids love it and really love the peggle game that’s included my grandkids love it and i love to see them happy once they beat this game will go back and buy another gets stuck on chapter 2 loading screen waiting for patch this game is fantastic and fun it plays well i highly recommend you get this game it is very fun sega made a great game this time its just as good as the previous yakuzas maybe even better went to the store walked to the counter bought the game then went home\\nstaff were nice and everything was right in the world love yakuza love turn base combat love this game if you have never played the yakuza series this game is a great way to dive right in engaging story goofy dumb jokes and a lot of weird bizarre sidequests thoroughly enjoyable experience great game with a lot of content the turn based combat is an interesting change of pace but makes total sense with the character development of the story wonderful side quests and mini games as well this is by far my favorite sega game there is so much you can do with the game besides the main story plus the main storyline is amazing the characters are great the environments are fun and there’s a great mix of comedy and action great story and world with multiple mini games and side quests love the way turn based combat is handled very dialogcut scene heavy so may not be for everyone great characters and a wonderful homage to classic turn based games love it get it play it get addicted i also bought new cod  assassins creed and i have only played this game since opening it leaving the other games to sit its like playing a crimeset soap opera the story very deep the character development are great humor is the classic cheesy humor in yakuza games but its delightful fights can get repetitive but they thought about that by giving us jobs to chose from to mix things up to keep you engaged you are given the controls to become a full blown capitalist one of my favorite parts of the game as it reflects my profession has lots of easter eggs to the pokémon world too but ill let you find them in game highly recommend playing through in its natural japanese voice setting its okay to read kids and much less corny although this is a huge improvement for sega  english speaking characters shenmue 2 for reference woof the english speaking setting is much better and translates over a bit more but you cant be more authentic then speaking japanese so do it you do not need to be a yukuza series fan to enjoy this game kasuga is a new character to a new world in a next generation of gaming get this explore the world and enjoy this uplifting hero drama it was good from the beginning gives you a overall feel of real life hunts you gotta have patience and technique to understand this game was worth it also might i add get the newer game as well this game will test your patience as well as your eyesight if you want a good hunting game this is it worst game ever a reason why i gave it one stars cuz i couldnt write a review without rating it my 9yr old likes he said a little hard for his age but likes it there is more to it than i thought takes some getting used to boring if u use the wrong caliber gun for the animal u lose points could of had more gun companies to choose from but the game was good it was very challenging but very good had good quality and it was very fun to play this game is not what i thought it would be was looking for a little more realistic hunting experience i got this game to see what its like and i cant complain at all i enjoy it alot and is fun to play this game is okay controls are kind of difficult not too bad boring but i gave up on it after update it deleted all my process and had to start over but wish the story mode was longer did not like careers mode always have to win the match wish it was like raw vs smack down we’re you can take a lost and win and loose the championship my daughter bought the game for herself so she could create her wrestler to team up with charlotte flair i bought this dumpster fire of a game for my kids and regret every cent of my purchase it’s like it always has been depends on how you want to play good game kind difficult but who’s not up for a good challenge every now and then plays well and is just as fun as past wwe games all in all it s what you would expect from a wwe game solid game  miss the old move list with combos versus this r1  button style same old 2k game it wasn’t much of a difference to me it is awsome plus the new pokemon caught a legendary on the first day victini  and i play every day i have loved pokemon ever since my first one gold i am very impressed with the creativity graphics gameplay new pokemon and everything unless you hate pokemon more than anything you will like it my only complaint is that it doesnt go on forever great job nintendo pokemon black is an awesome game there are great new pokemon  new gym leaders and cool things you can find evolving pokemon is fun and challenging for everyone girls boys women and menif you buy it you will be in love with pokemon so if you buy it will be totally worth itthe pokemons moves are amazing personally i think if you buy it nothing will make you return itits the best game ever buy it now youll never ever regret it   i must say this is a game that makes the series even better than ever i highly recommend this to a fan of the pokemon series it introduces new themes such as triple battles and rotation battles plus the music is very great and so are the graphics 9910 the story line was goodthe graphics were greatand the gameplay felt ok but what nintendo needs to understand is that a game needs to last long in order to be a successbut this game relies on its ridiculously short story line which takes 5 hours to beatthen theres legendary hunting which you can finish in about 30minmy bottom line is that this game is rely shortif you have 30 lying around you can pick it upbut if you want a game that last long pick up platinumassuming you didnt play dpor hgssthose games last a while this game is amazing this is easily the best generation since goldsilver in my opinion the game provides the best story of any previous pokemon game and manages to keep the basics intact the new pokemon you can find in the unova region look stupid and their names dont help them but once you play the game you start to fall in love with a lot of these pokemon like i did new pokemon are awesome i beat the whole game in less then 3 weeks love love love it btw if anyone has found an eevee please tell me where first of all the ending to part 1 was amazing because of the apperance of legendary pokemon the pokemon trainers were easy to beat expect the leader of team plasama over all this was a fun pokemon game with alot of twist and turns buy this game have fun one more thing the new pokemon are stupid this game was so much fun i went through the whole game 3 times it is never the same a good game for people who love pokemon theirs not a lot of playing in the game and theirs not a lot of funalso castelia city is ok but not as good as they made it seemoverall its a pretty good game but its not that long for a pokemon game i purchased this game for me and my family it’s clean fun and and love the two bonus games too it is a very fun game to play and  i like it very much great game engaging nice catchy music kids and adults too love it we only bought it for the peggle game that came with it old game that the girlfriend wanted to play looks good on the s and easy install we bought this at gamestop as used works perfect and saved  great family fun love this game my kids love the game it’s good clean family time fun i bought this for my husband since i had it and he loves it but we have a problem hes addicted to it now lol we both are overall this game served perfectly as a lazy day type of a game you never want to stop playing it’s incredible it requires you to have an xbox gold live membership to play im not going to buy an xbox gold live membership pretty good graphics and realism suck a little but overall it’s fun i bought this two weeks ago and still trying to get use to it it’s a hunting game there’s guns there’s animals that’s basically all you need to make it good but your character can walk through huge bushes but gets blocked by dandelions but at the end of the day it’s a good hunting game ive played better hunting games on mobile app \\r\\nwas really upset pretty much across the board on everything  from graphics to game play i am a hunter not a gamer but i do enjoy playing games on occasion have been playing a game i got at game stop called the hunter call of the wild  absolutely love it then i was told about the hunting simulator by a game stop employee  thought it would be great it is not graphics are very bad everything is just bad very big mistake buying this game did not enjoy it at all i gave it a one star because it would not let me give it a zero bought this a few days ago and it’s a waste of money the game is decent for the price and is good for people that want to learn about hunting the game is not so great i got is game and i dont like the game at all played most of game so far no glitches and about as real as a video is going to get it’s actually pretty dope i stopped watching wrestling after attitude era was over but i still enjoy this game even though i barely know anyone on it lol i love this line of wrestling games the characters are real career mode could of been way better i loved the game at first but then it completely became wack  maybe next year they will do better graphics are amazing husband has a lot\\nof fun playing not a whole lot different from past games in the series everything in the wwe universe is in this game  i even like the entrances  i like that the superstars perform the moves they are famous for so many events and arenas it sucks when you customize a belt for tag team it doesnt say it and it just cut out i like the intro beyond that it will get very old if you don’t have internet and no desire to create ur own storylines the graphics are lackluster and ive seen better on ps3 creative mode is not impressive to me  they have found of modes which are great ideas but i cant get beyond the poor mechanics and poor graphics oh and the announcers say the same thing all the time makes no sense to have two different create a character modes and not have them able to play together but awesome game otherwise this review was collected as part of a promotion i use this monitor for personal video editing school and games the only feature that could use a tune up is the preset picture modes but it is easily found online what settings to use for perfect picture quality the refresh rate is surprisingly noticeable as i cant go back to a lower refresh rate monitor haha i would also suggest getting a monitor mount as this does not have an adjustable feature included the built in usb port is very wonderful for my speakers aswell this monitor has made me not want to try any other monitor brands honestly i love it also the brightness range is spectacular ge this monitor now this review was collected as part of a promotion i am a student in school with a gaming laptop that i hook up to this monitor it has great fps and i would highly recommend this review was collected as part of a promotion i have been using this monitor for just under two years now and i absolutely love it i have not had a single issue with is while doing anything ranging from scrolling online to hardcore 12 hour gaming sessions i couldnt be happier with any other monitor especially as this is not too large not too large it is the exact size for comfortability and i would recommend this to anyone i bought this bad boy to top off a pc that i was building for my parents the image quality is wonderful but the build quality is lacking i would have been fine with it but the lack of tilt functionality was rough as the screen appeared somewhat tilted on my parents’ desk dad had to put a folded piece of paper under it this review was collected as part of a promotion i am not a gamer at all but when i saw this monitor i look good and the specs were great i cannot believe how crisp and clear and how quick the refresh rate is great is i would recommend this to anyone whether you are gaming or not because it will make everything you normally do from surfing the web or working on spreadsheets be so much christopher and claits very unclear and if youre gaming then you need it but if not its still a great monitor this review was collected as part of a promotion ive had this monitor for about 1 year and a half now and it has been the best gaming monitor ive ever owned the curve is perfect 144hz makes it butter smooth and the picture quality is amazing im pretty sure ill buy samsung monitors again in future this review was collected as part of a promotion i love the clarity of the monitors they make working from home a lot easier to review data as well gaming the graphics are very realistic and doesnt hurt my eyes this review was collected as part of a promotion i use this for school and gaming works great in dorm rooms or small apartments i take this thing everywhere and the display looks great this review was collected as part of a promotion i will use to play game to use for school and to do homework this review was collected as part of a promotion gaming and movies multitasking between the two and buying  selling on stockx pokemon black is a very awesome game because of the new pokemon and a bunch more new features ive always loved pokemon and to me the older versions are better because they bring back so many memories i really prefer pokemon black over white because i believe reshiram is stronger than zekrom i reserved this game and got it the morning it was released and from the moment i played i was drawn into its new landscape and the overall story however some of the creatures they choose are rather poor with certain ones but there are some i just was in awe of i loved that there where more 3d effects while traveling and in battle along with a few more areas if your a seasoned pokemon fan and have been since the begining then you will find this game rather easy to beat but it is still a fun installment in the series this game is fun to say the least it is a challenge and it takes a long while to become old with that being said you have to accept the fact that it is in fact a very basic game over the summer i enjoyed many nights of talking with my friends as i casually played with my coop partner worth a purchase if you want to spend a few bucks i picked up this game first game for ds only having played the older pokemon redblue and yellow im not a big fan of pokemon but a really big rpg fan i loved this game the story really had me going till the end i loved collecting all the different types of pokemon grant it some seemed a little childish but it was really in depth only problem once i beat the story i got burnt out and had to take a break before trying to catch all the pokemon in the game other than that it is a really awesome rpg i pretty much made this review for the people who are looking for a good rpg and do not know much about pokemon and the series must buy epic rpg getting all new ones coming out you should get this game its beter the online and i recomed this game to everyone out there thank you for reading get this game todayo yeah the online veison sucks get tis game on the xbox 360 i wish they had this for the wii this is a god pokemon gamea lot of new pokemonbut no pokemon from the old generations till the end of the gamei like the new triple battles too overall good game i bought this when it first came out my kids and i still play it we loved it so much i bought it for xbox 360 too i love the zombies i love the all the little side games you can do im even going to preorder the sims 3 super natural so i can get all the pvz gear this is just an awesome game if you want to play for fun or just kill some time i got this game the first day it was out and i played it for about 4 hours in a single sitting this game is amazing and the gym leader battles are intense some pokemon designs are pretty lame but most of them are amazing i love this game plants vs zombies to me is a very boring game it may have a long story mode but its so boring when you are finished i also hate the music because it plays over and over and over again all i have to say is i hate this game it is defantly the best game for ds in 2011 and it never gets boring plants vs zombies is great i have it on my computer as well this game also has peggle and zuma included they are awesome tooall in all plants vs zombies is great i would recommend this to a friend i have 37 ds games and out of all of them this is one of my favorites ive beaten the game and i caught nearly every legendary pokemon in but i still really like it sweet game to kill some time\\naddictive i have it on my phone to its really nice to see how much pokemon has gone through and how much its changed from the beginning with pokemon versions blue and red all the way to this pokemon may have been a laughing stock to some people who are too cool to play it or even look at it but when this was released a lot of people were talking about it  and now onto the review overall this game was really great it had really good sound music gameplay etc however theres a little thing that might be ugly at first but then you wont recognize it and that thing is the zoomed in sprites of your pokemon in the battle it looks pretty pixelated and unappealing but youll hardly notice it i recently bought this game before thanksgiving for less then 20 bucks i am so glad that i did i have played the pc version and was hooked i do like the xbox version much better then pc version because collecting the sun by hitting the button on the xbox is easier then clicking all over on the pc collecting it there is so much to do with this game adventure which you have to do if you want to unlock other parts of the game once you finish that you can access mini games which are way fun to do and puzzle games also zen garden which is cool you also get money which you can spend at crazy daves to upgrade stuff there is an online play i believe where you can view peoples houses and stuff i am not sure because i havent tried anything out also there is a coop and vs mode where you can play as zombies also in adventure mode two people can battle together plus you get two games peggle and zuma whats not to love what a fun fun fun game my kids and hubby love it too they are just as addicted as i am to pvz it def is a must have well the game is good the new pokemon are just a big no what has happened to pokemon since gen 1 it just keeps getting worse the gameplay is fun but way to easy the gym leaders keep getting weaker and your rivals suck whoever came up with the idea of team plasma  its not working the graphics where great and the story was easy but the lasting appeal is a 1 because it lasted me a week it took a whole week to finish a game the old ones last a long time because of the after storys and the other legendarys but this is a failure at time when you play the pc version it feels weird but youll get used to it overall great graphic great coop great gameplay the there is nothing better than this game i swear where do i start on this game well the new pokemon are stupid their names are stupid and you can only catch them until you beat the game seriously nintendo you dont even have pikachu in this game\\nit was fun at first then it got extremely boring if any new people to the pokemon world are reading this go to gamestop and buy pokemon platinum version the best game by far this is a great game for any age from a casual gamer to hardcore 5 stars my boys and i love playing this game i had to fight over the controller just to playlol 1 or 2 players can play since we bought it we shared it with all of our friends n family and yes they went out and bought it too lol improved over last years editionthe banter during the match still gets old really fast the tower mode and career mode are really good the game has plenty of characters and the usual deep amount of game modes but i find the gameplay not as good as previous entries but better than 18  the mini games involved in submission and pinfall are not as good as the 15 and 16 versions  i recommend those older versions for much less unless you need a new wrestlers just got the game a few days ago havent played a wrestling game in a while still getting the hang on it but great rosters  legends and titles fun wwe game  probably the best since 2008 wwe game i love this game the career mode storyline is so good i bought this game a week ago this game is nothing special at all\\r\\nthey make the reversals hard to do it’s either to fast to slow or shows green but doesn’t work properly \\r\\ni find the controls very slow and the character takes way to long to get up and do anything i’m actually close to just removing this game off my system because it’s so annoying this game has a lot of potential if they fixed a few things overall very good game only negative is the story mode it has some very good parts just wish it was longer or more elaborate got this for my nephew11  got it back 2days later cause he had issues with gameplay i tried playing and saw what he meant controls arent the greatest will be returning it others might love this game so check other reviews my kids love this game we wish all the characters were unlocked without having to buy a season pass for 2999 but other than that they live the game a very ambitious game i can see what the the developers had in mind but the game  ultimately fails to capture the true esque of what pro wrestiling is final score 510 my son loves it good quality fair price fast shipping i needed lithium batteries for my smoke detectors and wanted a reusable solution these are perfect they charge quickly and easily will be buying more to keep on hand for all of my battery powered devices it’s going to save me money in the long term and reduces waste from used batteries these are great charge relatively quickly  and are so simple i am thinking that i might even get the aaas so that i never am without batteries again these are great charge relatively quickly  and are so simple i am thinking that i might even get the aaas so that i never am without batteries again could not be more thrilled with this purchase i have a number of devices that require lithium aas and quickly exhaust their power supply in the past i have paid more for single use lithium aas than what i what i paid for these rechargeable ones these will save me hundreds of dollars in the coming months thank you gamestop power to the players controls are slow and either your to slow or to fast when it wants you to hit a button i love this game i wasnt sure about it at first so i downloaded the demo played through the first few levels and was hooked i went and bought the game that day i could play this game for days\\nthe graphics are great for this kind of game the sound isnt the best but they will do obviously the last appeal is 10 out of 10 it was challenging at points but thats what was great about it\\ni would for sure recommend this game to anyone its one of my favorite xbox games i mean you cant not buy this game and just let the zombies take over can you my nephew is a wrestling nut and loves it for a wrestling game it’s pretty legit if your looking for some real fun and need a brake from battlle field cod and halo this is it plants vs zombies might just be the best arcade game ever made and on top of that you get peggle which is amazing  zuma pretty for a really low price if you do not own this i feel bad for you cause trust me go get it you will not regret it amazing graphics but controls can be hard to catch up on my boys 7 and 10 like it but there are constant tutorials on extra moves that seem hard to follow but the stories are great the fluid movements make it feel real highly recommend for wwe fans best 20 dollars i ever spent in coop mode you can do adventure or versus i have only played white but i know its the same i luv it  great fun for the familygraphics are awsome and you can create any wrestler in the word this is one of the best strategy games ive ever play its got two cool thing zombies and action plants and the 1 vs 1 is pretty fun when one player is plants and another is zombiez really good game but at the end once i collected all the pokemon it got really boring the graphics were really good sound awesome but the lasting appeal was ok it was addictive very fun to play but the thing is that once you finish everything there is too do it gets quite boring overall pretty good game my player mode could be put together better it’s seems like it was made in 2007 last years was better my player gets worse every year i have played this before and might get it today and i love it i would recommend this game to anyone who loves pokemon great graphics great sounds and music and great gameplay wwe 2k 19 its by far the best wwe game by 2k they finally gave it a percentage of the attention they give nba 2k and it shows hopefully they build upon this and make 2k20 even better plants vs zombies is a very fun and addicting game the graphics are totally cartoon but that doesnt change how fun it is you have to use lots of strategy to complete each level the different plants and zombies get very creative and funny i would suggest this buying this game i love this gameive had this game for 4 months nowand its still funmy sister had pokemon heart goldbut the graphics suckedthese graphics are awsome the graphics are really good game play is awesome the best part of the game is vs and the campaign this game is the best pokemon game ever made on ds great graphics fun addicting game nakamura especially this game is action packed and hard to stop playing this game is tottaly awsomeyou can cacth the legendarypokemon victinireshiramtornduskyreumvolcaronaand landorusyou can transfer pokemon from other games to black fun wrassling game carreer mode is spiced up creation suite is great as always and an excellent 2k showcase not much new for universe mode however the first time i ever expeirenced the game was a demo onlinei thought it was a awsomefuncooladdictive gamewhen i got the game for the xbox 360 i played the game for about a a month then the game kinda got hard and you had so many plants but could only use a certain a mount after a while i started playing other games and forgot about it\\nbut dont get me wrong its an exellent game and it comes whith two other games with it alright i did enjoy black when i first heard about it i was going yes yes then after a little while i was thinking itd be roughly the same as any other pokemon game save for the unova regions quirks\\n\\nat long last i got the game on the 14th and ive enjoyed it since i must say the global link is a great idea something that im glad they implemented this generation use of wpa wififor us dsiusers means less dropped battles and trades the gts resemble the one introduced in hgss and i love the random matchupyet another feature ive longawaited the graphics look great as are the movements similar to the ones introduced in stadium and every other homeconsole spinoff the battle subway is quite unique in my opinion and i love how much attention they devoted to the trains aloneim a fan of trains\\n\\nalright there are a few cons though but nothing major\\n\\nnot every pokemon can be seen or captured until nintendo releases an event japan has had a bunch so far mainly dream world but everywhere else lacks events to introduce the remaining few pokemon unavailablecan you say keldeo\\n\\npixelation the idlemovements of pokemon are awesome but it doesnt look to great on some if theyre on your team for example rapidash looks awesome as the pixels are moving fast with the fireeffect however zapdos looks somewhat distorted from the back\\n\\nconnection i love how the cgear teases me whenever it finds a signal but im still required to go to dsi settings and configure it to work not funny cgear\\n\\nstory length nintendo seems to want to emphasize connectivity even more the single player adventure isnt as long as it was in crystal for instance granted theres so much to do afterwards but still id have liked a little more conflict with team plasma\\n\\nlack of a move tutor why nintendo why this could have made sweet hearts more useful rather than just restoring 20hp think of the shards system in dpplt\\n\\nnames alright this i a low blow but ducklett really nintendo you failed on some of the names thank goodness we can still nickname them \\n\\nas for prosin addition to everything stated earlier\\n\\npokedex the pokedex now is more accurate lets say for example if you catch or see a shiny patratwhy you would want a patrat to begin with is beyond me it will record it as shiny\\n\\ngraphics this ought to shut up those who say the pokemon series has terrible graphics the pokemon series has never been about graphics but nintendo updated them because thats all gamers think about these days\\n\\nmusic another definite win for ninty the music is greatly improved as usual there are so many memorable themes with the hidden options in some areas to add sound\\n\\nconnectivity were using infrared again which is great because it means i dont have to fly or walk to a town just to save and wait for it to connect swapping friend codes is much easier too\\n\\nversion differences this makes it more necessary to trade with whitesince this is a black review than with the counterversions in past generation than for just a few pokemon white has more pokemon while black has more items so youll be hoping to find someone to get you a few little pokemon from white forest in exchange for some fire stones from black city\\n\\nseasons another update from gen ii we now have seasons this affects the terrain the pokemon that appear and makes an otherwise uninteresting pokemon unique\\n\\nthats about it enjoy the game nothing new worth the updated roster confusing menus removed voice acting from career mode time for a complete overhaul of the series instead of yearly roster updates i am more of a fps or rpg kind of gamer but plants vs zombies has alot of replay value and alot of never ending fun the game is very cheap for those going through financial issues can afford it even if you think it will suck you will probably like it and be hooked i have been a fan for as long as i can remeber and being under 18 of age i would say this game is perfect for new pokemon fans  or some one like me who has never played a pokemon game i have not recently watched or kept up to date with the series but for not doing this i completly understand what is going on i recommend this a friend of mine were talking about it and she showed it to me i enjoy it i am a girl i love gaming but this has a twist to the normal pokemon sega instead team rocket their is a different team i dont want to be a spoiler this is a must buy it may sound great but honestly it isnt that great its tooo hard for me and its not that easy and honestly i dont like iti just got it and im thinking about trading it in honestly i dont like it that much this was the last game for the ds to some the 3ds was about a month away and no one could wait but nintendo pulled out a new pokemon main series game to end the ds off and we had no problem waiting another month for the 3ds this game in my opinion is what pokemon diamand and pearl should have been it actually boosted up the graphics made the pokemon always moving added a new camera view both in battle and out and made online play accessable plus the game has a lot of content including 150 all new pokemon so lets get on with the review graphics nothing groundbreaking but they still look very nice and the animations are great features the game features 150 new pokemon that might be enough to make you want to buy this game plus there is a whole new region to explore with new cities characters and a whole new dramatic story plus all of the pokemon from past versions are able to be caught or traded after the main game is over so replay value is pretty high gameplay the gameplay is awesome it is pokemon and its fast paced unlike diamand and pearl were you run around and explore areas finding your way through puzzles and areas and pitting your pokemon together in classic rpg battles pokemon in its prime conclusion this game is awesome if you do not own either black or white buy one of them or both these games are true pokemon classics enough said this review was collected as part of a promotion i use the monitor for gaming and my dex i love how the monitor takes advantage of my ps5 console graphics it looks perfect for when i use it for samsung dex this review was collected as part of a promotion this monitor is great i absolutely love the high refresh rate and would recommend this as a cheap way to get a quality monitor however i would not call this a gaming monitor it has a va panel which causes some minor streaking and some major streaking with adaptive sync enabled while playing games also notable i tried mounting it with a vesa monitor stand the included stand didnt fit on my desk but it did not work i had to bend the monitor arms mount in order to get the screws to go in i do not know if this was the monitors fault or the arms fault however overall this is a great monitor just dont expect to get more than what you pay for compared to higher end monitors this review was collected as part of a promotion i use the monitor for gaming

kids toys these are worth it most horrible game i ever played in my life i returned this game 2 days later the controls are trash and the graphics are horrible i never experienced such a horrible game in my life dont buy this game you will regret it great game could use some improvement on the wwe universe section game is fun to play its pretty cool you can play by yourself or online you can earn different people the more you play has to many glitches in match always freezing in main event overall yall rushed the released before perfecting it not the best graphics but still overall a good game create a character was too hard to understand and i gave up great game with great graphics and creation modes showcase was a bit short though mycareer isnt what youd expect and its a story not your own career it was cheesy universe mode needs to freaking step it up and make it like svr 2007 gm mode good game lacks replayability lackluster roster same old wwe 2k boring returned it within days of

better than his old one the size and resolution makes it to where he can see everything on the game screen and that it looks great so much fun so addictive one of my favorite games on my xbox i think they couldve made it a little more challenging but other than that i love it this review was collected as part of a promotion i used it for gaming at families house id take a benq or asus monitor for competitive edge or a different sansung monitor 2429 inches is perfect tho plants vs zombies is a very intriguing game i bet none of us would think that wed be playing a tower defense for weeks on end\\n\\nthe concept is very simple and it actually works better than youd think its always fun to see what lawn setup works best and how you can create new and wild plant formations to clear away the zombies also the gridstyle map really does work well as a mouse substitute for the xbox 360\\n\\nthere are issues with this game too you may hear everyone rave about how addicting the game is but it really is easy to let go and forget to come back to the gameplay really isnt something that will leave you wanting more and more some levels are very difficult and will force a lot of gamers off after 20 attempts you just lose interest and its hard coming back to it\\n\\noverall with its awesome price and loads of extra content this is definitely a game i would recommend no matter what system you have this game should be in your collection\\naddicting gamehas good strategy and the zombies are fun to blowup\\nfrom mom to dadif you put the controller in there hand you might not great it back must buy this game is really fun before this game i never thought what would happen if it was plants vs zombies this game was orignally on pc then xbox 360 marketplace now it is a release title im glad it had a console release because i dont have xbox live this game is full of fun levels of great graphics and combat this is something that reminds me of castle crashers anyway if you see this game buy it this will be money well spent every level is very fun to play you have to be very careful on where you put your plant if its in the wrong place your in trouble vegaskid says 910 i was not much of a believer until i played the pc version the xbox360 version is way better of course this is one of those games that you can play when you are tired of shooting it out in your favorite shooter or exhausted of playing your sports games this game will actually help your brain relax and take a much needed break with something different you can play this game in between your hardcore sesions for the price it is an excellent value the graphics are crisp and simple the sounds will also make you crack up laughin sometimes it does have repetitive soundtracks but they are not annoying there is just this element of good ol fun about this game within the game theres not only the story mode but puzzle and minigames also theres no online capability but it does allow for you to play with a friend on the same screen coop vs and story the main story is not long but then you can replay it with new challenges over and over so in a way it is unlimited it also has a garden section where you can actually grow plants and sell them for money money that you can use to increase your arsenal of plants and unlock other features in the game very entertaining for all ages and dont get me wrong i am as hardcore gamer as it comes but this is just a good fun and funny game i gotta give credit when deserved enter crazy dave this is the best arcade game youll getreally i play for 7 straight hours then i got tiredi luv 3 these games the pokemon serieshope they keeep continue making pokemon games for many yrs 2 comed this game 2 me is like an adventure and u kept learning how 2 better urself and how 2 love train explore ur pokemonif u get this game i hope u love it just as well as i do or maybe even more having new pokemon new featuresand many more this is one of the best pokemon games in the pokemon series even if raquaza is my favorite pokemon ever reshiram is second one of the best new features is the pokemon global link or gl pokemon black emerald soulsilver and pokemon ranger guardian signs are some of the best pokemon games go pokemon company all in all this is a great game pokemon has always been my favorite series and probably always will be its the best pokemon game ever everyone should play it and see its awsomness like the reshirem appearentsget the game pokemon black is now one of my favorite games i love how the pokemon company intrutused new legendary pokemon and other pokemon so start from a new adventure with your starter pokemon by the way did i say this game is beast i got this game the day it came out very reluctant about getting it i was reluctant bc i thought i would miss generations 14 i do miss it but i like this game very much and i still like generation 1 the best ive been looking forward to this game ever since it was first announced the 156 new pokemon are a great addition to the national pokedex and look very cool i pre ordered this game so i could catch victini exclusive to an event that occured prior to the writing of this review this game has many 3d rendered places and even a full 3d rendered city unlike the previous games that mainly focused on a birds eye view after beating the game there is still much to do including transfering pokemon from your older games i hope they release the rumored pokemon gray best pokemon game to date great graphics better than white fun to play more than lasting great story hope they make a battle revolution for this game soooooooooooooooooooooooo gooooooooooood i cant stop playing it this is the best game eva in the world itottally like loved it this review was collected as part of a promotion i bought these about 2 months ago and couldnt be more happier  i use them in my flash light and i use my flashlight every night i still havent had to change out my batteries normally i would have went through several pairs definitely recommend this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer batteries are always my go to i needed these for my sons toys and it makes the toy work so great they last super long and make everything work better and faster with these i love energizer batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion having a 98 lb dog means lots of walks  walks in the morning afternoon evening and even in the middle of the night  with means i have to have a flashlight always ready  i don’t want to stumble  the batteries not only made my flashlight shine bright but they have lasted a long time this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer products have never failed me so when i used the max alkaline d batteries with my flashlight i knew i was not going to be disappointed the light from the flashlight is bright and strong and i expect the batteries to last a long time like they usually do energizer is always up to par never drains fast and never disappoints this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer max alkaline d batteries are truly the longest lasting battery ive used for my \\r\\nportable radio i plan on sticking to this particular brand because i need a reliable battery especially with having little ones i live in the south so we experience hurricanes and power outages therefore the need for a working flashlight and radio are crucial with energizer max i know im getting the best longest lasting battery out there this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer batteries are my favorite i love that they last a long time so i dont have to replace them often u put the energizer max d batteries in my flashlight and they work great i have gone and purchased more in different sizes to have on hand \\r\\nenergizer is a trusted brand and overall great batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion we love how long our energizer max alkaline d batteries lasted they are always a brand we can trust and rely on for long term use i would buy again and highly recommend for anyone looking to restock their battery supply this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries are amazing they stay charged for really long periods of time even with continuous usage they work great in children’s toys they are easy to use and it only takes a couple to last for weeks it’s a product i can trust and i am comfortable buying each time it’s durable and it lasts this review was collected as part of a promotion i got this product about a couple weeks ago and i finally got to use them on my fishing trip i put them in my aerator in my minnow bucket we fished all day and the next morning they were still as strong as when i put them in this review was collected as part of a promotion i was using a different brand of d batteries in a flashlight i use to walk my dog at night it seemed like i was always having to replace them so i gave these a try it was totally worth the added cost as they show no hint of wearing out you guys sent me a european game i meanit works fine and everything its still in english and the switch is region free but dont you guys not take foreign games the game translates great to the nintendo switch lite platform fast paced game  i love it this was a really cool  solid game pretty difficult at sometimes but overall good game came with the original case very good condition on preowner great game play story line my switch handles the graphics well love this game why no coop campaign\\r\\n\\r\\ncoop campaign with your best friend and his kid is like going on vacation\\r\\n\\r\\nplease include it in the next incarnation it’s an innovative fps because playing defensively will kill you you need to plow forward for life and ammo it’s repetitive but in a good way kinda like playing a bunch of tetris non stop action blasting my way through the game huge guns  big bosses good story visuals are great a lot of cameos in the game\\r\\nwell worth the money it’s a must add to the collection fun game was challenging though for my girlfriend who’s not a hardcore gamer she gave up on final boss awesome for mx fans i wish there was more stunt riding and free ride locations though graphics are horrible for the switch it’s pretty fun on playstation though cant honestly say if this is a great game or a bad game bought it for my 4 year old tired to help him learn how to play but it was rather difficult though me and him play several other racing games together but couldnt get into this one this game is quite fun to play definitely very challenging and fast pace this has got to be my favorite dirt bike game on the market right now i grew  up playing the mx unleashed series and while this game is fun to play it definitely has got nothing on mx unleashed but is in my opinion a lot better than monster energy sx and moto racer the controls are confusing the game wasnt bad i was just no good at it lol i bought the first one because i was sceptical about paying so much for it dont buy the 1st it is terrible but i have been watching lots of gameplay on the new one and everything is decent besides one thing theres no free ride in mx games anymore what happen to freestyle i dont want to smash laps all day in real life let alone a game atleast mx  vs atv supercross have like 4 levels to free ride on but the game is all face and no mess around explore with friends like it should be i have this game for my ps4 from the first one to the third this is by far the best of the three  tracks are laid out more realistic the customization is great from the gear to the bikes freaking killer graphics my daughter could even tell the difference in a muddy or dry track next thing they need is to give a free ride option  do not buy this game if you are looking for quality my ten year old saved all his money to buy this game on its release date he has been talking about it every day for weeks he even woke up two hours early to play it before school he played it for less than a minute and immediately noticed the poor quality of the game i immediately called nintendo and asked for a refund which we might see in 5 business days extremely disappointed we are huge motocross fans and riders i really wish they didnt give us such a let down controls were glitchy and not always responsive short mycareer mode and no womens career mode the graphics are phenomenal the presentation is awesome as well honestly when i read about the improvements i didnt think it would be much but you have to actually play it to appreciate several little things that all add up to what i think is the biggest improvement of the series so far great game love the carreer mode better than previous wwe games its great allot more options on match types most of the nxt guys are in game some animations are funky this is one of the best in the series so far excellent graphics many different play modes and a very detailed creator system for multiple aspects of the game im still not a fan of the submission holds system but otherwise i highly recommend this game to wrestling fans it’s a good game but the controls are a little slow i like the reaction time like the first few games that came out before the “push button and it reacts slow” action love how much they have added to the game play i honestly wish the story was longer and had more room for a wrestler build in the my player couldnt wait for it to come out \\r\\nbeen a wrestling fan since i was 8 years old i just recently bought this game and am so glad i did its the best installment in the series for a while as is often the case with 2k games and in particular the wwe series the game definitely has some bugs and flaws they dont ruin the gameplay experience but do take a bit away from it outside of that this is the best game wwe has released in at least a decade fun new features solid graphics huge roster hours of entertainment to be had with the retooled career and universe modes not a perfect game but definitely a step in the right direction and leaps and bounds better than 2k18 was only knocks are the general glitchyness and repetitive commentary this review was collected as part of a promotion the resolution and clarity of the monitor is incomparable this review was collected as part of a promotion i used it through cna school and

of a promotion this monitor was a big upgrade from my previous samsung monitor for gaming the 144hz refresh rate stands out as the video is buttery smooth the color reproduction is great especially after calibrating the monitor blacks can be a little deeper as this is not an oled monitor and of course there are options with higher refresh rates outside of that this monitor is a great choice for

part of a promotion its hard to know what to say except energizer makes awesome batteries the only thing wrong with energizer batteries is that they last so long that i am not sure how the company makes any money waiting for people to replace them this review was collected as part of a promotion i put these batteries in my husbands flashlight he uses his light almost every night and batteries have always been a problem not with these we have had them in his light for a month now and they are going strong i am replacing all of our lights and lanterns batteries to these it is going to save me so much money i definitely recommend these for any use you may have this review was collected as part of a promotion the energizer max alkaline d batteries come in a pack of two the batteries are silver and black with some red for color it comes in an easy opening package that can be ripped apart instead of using scissors it has the standard d battery size they are longer lasting with a shelf life of ten years these would be great for camping trips for lanterns or flashlights overall the energizer max alkaline d batteries work well this review was collected as part of a promotion i’ve used these batteries for over a month now and im very happy i have an automatic trashcan that’s super sensitive so it opens when you simply walk by this results in the batteries wearing fast i originally used a cheap dollar pack and they didnt last even a month these have exceeded that and are still going strong i have faith that i’ll get a few more months out of them which makes them worth it this review was collected as part of a promotion these energizer max alkaline d batteries have lasted a long time we use these in our bigger flashlights and lanterns and love how well they hold battery life energizer is the only way to go for long lasting batteries you get your money worth plus more this review was collected as part of a promotion my daughter has a toy that requires d batteries and the toy takes a lot of battery and batteries usually last a week or so these energizer batteries have lasted close to a month so far and hasnt seemed to lose any power the toy has worked perfectly and hasnt lost function due to poor batteries i know from now on to use these batteries on that toy since these batteries have outlasted any other batteries i have tried this review was collected as part of a promotion no matter what anyone tells you i do believe energizer batteries last longer than off brand ones these have been put in a toy for my daughter since the day we received them and the toy is still going strong normally we do have to change the batteries every few weeks these batteries are great and we will only purchase energizer from now on this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer max d batteries have a great life expectancy rate we put these in my son’s race car track which eats through batteries like crazy  sometimes we have to switch batteries in the middle of playing  energizer max batteries lasted through 3 sessions of playing with his race track which is amazing  these batteries would be great for our camping lanterns as well as we wouldn’t have to worry about changing batteries during our trips the package opened easily and batteries loaded exactly as they should we were impressed with their power and longevity this review was collected as part of a promotion i have been a consumer of energizer for a long time these energizer max alkaline d batteries brought my dim flashlight i keep by the front door back up and it now as bright as when i purchased it definitely recommend this review was collected as part of a promotion these energizer max batteries are now my goto batteries for emergency items such as flashlights i love that these have a long shelf life 10 years which make them perfect to store in an emergency kit these work as expected and i have had no issues i feel like these energizer batteries are also much more reliable than other brands overall im very happy with this product and will continue to purchase in the future always a great game to play took some getting used to playing it on the switch but is still tons of fun super fun intense run  gun reboot of an already great game it was a lot of fun and a great introduction to the nintendo switch its brutal i love it and its easy as all heavens above to play it on switch fantastic game filled with lots of action and tons of nods to the original series of games great quality game so far the graphics are top notch worth the price definitely this is a must have on switch just have some extra space available for the multiplayer update it looks and runs beautifully and i’m even enjoying the online matches love how i can play doom on the go despite the loss in quality when compared to xbox or ps4 excelente game a bit disappointed on the port still fluent though the game itself is superb i have been playing the doom series since 93 when it came out on pc i was 3 at that time slaying demons on my dads lap and i have to say it never disappoints except for the movie adaptations  like all the other pokemon games this one is great if you like the series id definately recomend this one i love the gameplay plot and graphics but nintendo is starting to get careless they had an easy time making the pokemon in red and blue but now they are scrafty and alomomola the pokemon images are still great but the names are getting dumb on the other hand the game is great the legendaries are very cool and the storyline is amazing i think that the starters stats are getting to be way higher than before and the legendaries are way too fast i really loved beating this game and hope there will be a third pokemon grey preferably with kyurem as the main legendary pokemon is back in another installment in the series pokemon black and white in the unova region when i started this game i imediately noticed how the characters are very pixelated i think nintendo spent so much time on the region that they slightly neglected that actual people along with the pokemonafter all the people are what we are really going to be looking at even if youve never played a pokemon game before you will love this game also for any returning fans buy it no matter what type of games you like this game is a must buy 10 out of 10 stars i dont have any other pokemon games so i cant compare this to any of them right when i started this game i became addicted in my oppinion this is the best game ever some new pokemon are awesome and others are ok this game has funlyannoying puzzlesone thing i was surprised about was that the starters evolve pretty lateyou need to get to level 36 or level 35 to evolve your starter into the last evolution but in previous games you evolve at level 30 however that always make me think when i level up come on you have to evolve this time i love pokemon i know  ima geek but i love my dimond gameand i own 24 stuffed animles and all the movies im 13 and ive loved it sense like 3 or 4and the whole concept of new pokemon it genuies i like playing pokemon but this been the best pokemon game ever me and my cousin were playing this game togther is was so much fun if ur a hardcore pokemon gamer dont wait get this game now im am truly amased with this game it has some awesome mon like snivy and archeopsthe season change finally and best of all its addictingly fun for any fan of pokemon at first i was a bit iffy about the whole new region new pokemon thing but decided to try it out it turned out to be the best buy ive ever made this game is absolutely incredible the story line is amazing and the graphics are a big improvement over past pokemon games also team plasma isnt like team rocket or galactic or whatever they want to liberate pokemon unlike team rocket or galactic who just want to take over the world and make pokemon slaves and all that jazz and the new pokemon are awesome 10 stars pokemon black has tons of new pokemonthey were creative in the namestraining is a lot easierthe graphics are just amazingthe gym leaders are very coolthe game has 3d sceens that are amazingthe ir thingy is amazing with how fast it is i bought this as my christmas present and i don’t regret it nice game 2 players a gift for holidays great deal ive had it for about 3 months i really enjoy it  wrestling is two thumbs its got a few hiccups nothing major  if u like wwe i will enjoy  my only real complaint is the announcing i hate it  lmao this game is pretty good i wish they would fix the online servers since they have been buggy for many years now i think the graphics are pretty good and the controls are pretty solid i got this item for christmas and the disc is in great condition ps4 version is good and obviously suits my gaming needs this game is okay but i miss the great features the old smackdown vs raws with less confusing controls these controls are ridiculous these days gameplay was an adjustment since i hadnt bought a wrestling game since 2003 but i got the hang of it and became fun the menu system in creation mode is a gigantic one which makes it somewhat confusing the soundtrack is awesome as well with lots of uptempo metal and rap to get you pumped up to start slamming guys around lol i got it for xmas and havent stopped playing it yet graphics are great this game is a huge improvement from the last version i have always enjoyed the 2k sports games i really enjoy this game very life like great graphics game mechanics are difficult this review was collected as part of a promotion i use this monitor mostly for gaming and occasionally school work i love that it comes with 144hz display and a 4ms response time with a fhd freesync display which is excellent for gaming the curved screen also makes the games feel a lot more imersive cant get a better monitor for the price this review was collected as part of a promotion this monitor has it all 144hz hardly any ghosting comfortable ports  a nonhideous curve the only think it is missing is a vesa mount other than that this monitor is 100 worth it this review was collected as part of a promotion using this for gaming on my ps5  its great responds well  have no real problems this review was collected as part of a promotion i used this monitor for dota 2 gaming streaming it has some best features and performed very well i will recommend this monitor this review was collected as part of a promotion i have two of these for gaming and work good screen quality and 144hz is nice can plug multiple things into one monitor so it makes using multiple devices easy only thing i would complain about is the glossy plastic design it grabs fingerprints so easily this review was collected as part of a promotion i would use this for work and playing video games with my daughter this review was collected as part of a promotion i use this monitor for anything and everything the curved aspect ratio is edal for gaming and working this review was collected as part of a promotion it has a good refresh rate perfect size for my set up the colors it gives out are pretty good monitor stopped working after 10 months now 20 of the screen has no images i paid a premium for this monitor expecting a highquality highperforming reliable monitor now it is useless i do not recommend this product i purchased this monitor last year and now two months after the warranty expired the bottom of the screen all of a sudden has flickering lines on start up  when it has been powered off for some time i am not sure how when or why this occurred but i think your better off buying that expensive acer one the first time rather then this and then another a year after you buy it i do not have a photo of it right this second but as soon as i start up again tomorrow ill grab one this case is pretty awesome very well made and my switch fits nicely with the grip on it the only downfall is the way you secure the switch i’m not a fan of the double velcro straps i highly recommend this case and the grip to go with it nice size not to big not to small holds almost everything price isn’t to high my swich just doesnt fit into the sots its nice and sturdy and the straps hold it down but it still slides around its secure enough but not what i was expecting perfect size for everything every fits except the dock but i can fit a few games charger and controller works great for the nintendo switch hold everything i needed plus some this review was collected as part of a promotion ive been pleased with products from energizer before so i was excited to try these max alkaline d batteries i am happy with this product i used these batteries in my keyboard and they provide plenty of power this review was collected as part of a promotion i received energizer max batteries to try  i have been a long time user of this brand and wonderd about the max bit  will it truly make a difference\\r\\n\\r\\nwell i got the d size batteries and threw them into my mag light flashlight  heavy duty flashlight that i keep around for all sorts of uses \\r\\n\\r\\ni was surprised at how much brighter it seemed to light up the room  before yes it would light up the area nicely but seemed a bit dim  kind of like the difference of a brand new showroom automobile with fresh not hazy headlamps compared to a car with hazy headllamps  yes they can both light up the area nicely but one has a better clarity and brightness over the other\\r\\n\\r\\ni found these batteries did a very nice job and seemed to last a bit longer  always a bit hard to truly judge without having 2 exact same flashlights 2 sets of batteries only with 1 being the normal versus the newer max batteries changing them both at the same time and light up the lights and just wait it out to see which lasted longer  \\r\\n\\r\\noverall i felt that they were lasting and working better for me and seemed to brighten the area a bit better  as i get older my eyes enjoy more light and i felt thes batteries helped give me a bit more benefit than others in the past this review was collected as part of a promotion these energizer batteries were delivered quickly and packaged well the d size are sometimes hard to find but im glad energizer offers a dual pack this also states its the max which im excited to see how long that lasts in my devices usually ds run out quickly energizer is a good brand too this review was collected as part of a promotion i always want to have all variety of batteries on hand because you never know what things are going to take i used these recently in an older flashlight and they seem to be very powerful and longlasting no issues this review was collected as part of a promotion we have three kids under 10 and go through many batteries throughout the year  energizer is the only brand that seems to be worth its salt  we will always purchase this product dont be fooled by the discount off brands its not worth it this review was collected as part of a promotion i always look for the energizer brand when buying batteries as they are excellent quality that last forever  these max batteries are no exception  i’ve had them in one of my daughter’s toys that she plays with for hours on end for two weeks now  the batteries have lasted with no sign of running out of power  i highly recommend energizer batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion i love the energizer brand of batteries they are long lasting compared to other brands we used these in some kid toys and they made the toys last longer than ever very satisfied with our battery purchase this review was collected as part of a promotion i bought this brand of batteries a coyole weeks ago for my flash light and im so glad i did they work great have a great battery life and last for weeks definitely worth the money i paid will buy again this review was collected as part of a promotion as a family we have always used energizer batteries and they have never let us down obviously good quality long lasting expiration dates and who doesnt love the energizer bunny after trying the energizer max batteries we definitely will be buying these they seem to give a little bit more power and definitely last longer we will continue to be an energizer battery family m will definitely recommend these to our friends this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer batteries are always reliable these are no exception we have been using them for a couple weeks now regularly without any degradation in performance for basic dbatteries i would highly recommend its amazing what doom accomplished on the go granted it wasnt the best game graphically but i have doom in the palm of my hands now something the ps4 xbox and the ps vita could never do good game not for those that like to feel invincible you will die great action game with plenty of difficulty to keep you on your toes every so often there comes a time when i want to just sit back and play an fps thats actually challenging doom is the game i was looking for its the perfect game to play if you want to take your mind off things or just pass the time i never felt exessively frustrated when i died because it always felt like my fault as the player rather than the games fault and that is exactly how it ought to be just dont play it on ultranightmare unless youre some kind of masochist i rate it five out of five in graphics gameplay and lasting appeal fun game but it’s  really a stretch to call this one doom i had to set the difficulty to low and mess with the motion settings to be able to play still a must have shooter for the switch as there aren’t much out there at all controls are difficult and the graphics aren’t nearly worth it i know it’s a good game but your telling me it’s 14ish on the ps4 but to have it on the go it’s 40 extra dollars great game converted to the nintendo switch lots of action and fighting off hordes of demons i’m giving this game a half rating although on most consoles it’s actually an awesome game i have a ps4 version now \\r\\nthe nintendo switch is the downfall the operations of the game on the nintendo switch are absolutely horrible for anybody choosing this title on this platform it’s ight graphics and chuck loading is low and slow pokemon is a really great game as any other pokemon but sadly pokemon is pokemon all though there are some new great pokemon entries such as zekrom and reshiram also it is missing the greatest icons from pokemon like pikachu squirtle and etclasting appeal is great because wifi is a great addition to all new pokemon games so it will last for a prolonged time for battling it out and trading with friends and strangers overall this game is a full package of surprises and fun it is a must have for hardcore pokemon fans and a great addition to any strategic type gamer the unova region is the best region in the game there are many things to do and youll run into your rivals alot the game has a good plot but there are just some big issues the biggest one is the pokemon the pokemon are very weird and ugly it looked like they were just trying to mke as many as they can the other is the graphics i like that the pokemon move but its pixelated the final reason is the triple battle i personally love the triple battles but youll have a triple battle about 3 times in the whole game this is terrible because it was one of the most advertised things about this game so to conclude if you love pokemon get it but if you dont just save your money well its fun but its too short and by that i mean you could beat it in 2 days i beat it in 3 daysand when you finish the game theres nothing to doall there is to do is get all the pokemon and if you want a fun endless game i recommend pokemon soul silver i got pokemon black with a good impression that it was going to be awesome and epic just like all the others i was sadly mistaken the pokemon are ugly and not cool the old ones are way better they are obviously in it for the money now and have no compassion towards it 3d imaging is just lame to me i dont care about the graphics i just care if i can see what im doing while having fun pesonally ive been playing pokemon since firered and black and white versions are just not worth it to me pokémon black is a great and refreshing addition to the series generation v adds in new pokémon 155 new ones to be exact which is the greatest amount added to date to excite and surprise both new and continuing fans the updated graphics from diamondpearlplatinum are beyond what anyone who followed the game’s announcements at e3 expected including me game freak took the capabilities of nintendo’s ds a system that came out over five years ago and pushed them to their absolute maximum at first glance the graphics seem the same but the battle animations as well as a few of the cities really pop out in stunning detail having said that this review is mainly geared toward the continuing fans that understand the game’s underlying mechanics such as ivs evs and the nature of breeding for competitive play\\nafter you beat the elite four you can put two pokémon into the daycare i’ve heard that you can only place one unless you do beat the e4 the breeding process is the same as in previous games however the poké gear doesn’t exist anymore making it much more difficult to know when an egg is ready also it is worth mentioning that the path directly by the daycare is much shorter than in diamondpearlplatinum making it more difficult to travel the thousands of steps needed\\nthe unova region brings a variation to the traditional battle towerfrontier with the new battle subway although differently titled it still brings the battle points system back with the same kinds of competitive items such as the focus sash choice bandscarfspecs life orb the power items as well as a select few tms on a quick side note tms in the blackwhite games do not go away after use once you have it it stays for good which is always a good thing for creating more than one pokémon with amore than adequate move set\\ntraining pokémon in evs in the blackwhite games is very easy using the power items on a pokémon while training them works exceptionally well some of the early cities have pokémon in the wild grass that are low level and can be grinded easily\\npokémon black and white really help improve upon its previous game’s mechanics and breeding systems the new and improved battle subway paving the way for easy access to battle items as well as tms lasting forever really add to its appeal in the mlg aspect of pokémon all in all pokémon black and white are excellent additions to the series and i highly recommend that anyone with a ds pick this game up immediately pokemon black is one of those regular pokemon gamesnothing much but you cant stopi bought it and i wasnt suprised but it did meet my expectationsthe storyline is okay but not awesomei would recommend this to boys but not menthe fact that all new pokemon are added and it is a whole new place to explore is craaazzzy awesometheir games are going in the right direction for surei love the game because it is addicting just like any other pokemon game but if you really think about it its just a simple game but its fun somehow for a lot of people including me it is a great game but i got bored but i recomend it to pokemon fans pokemo black is a great game but the cries arent theyre names like the show the graphics need improvement bu the story line is great the starers are as always watergrass and of course firebut why cant u catch botgh legends tell me they took out many things and i hate the lack of graphics plus they took out many other pokemon including legendaries today i checked online to see about the rumored pokemon grey version to see if there was really gonna be a third but they decided why just make a copy of pokemon black and white with a better storyline and increased graphics so they decided to make an entirely new game with a better view of n and maby a new region but probably no new pokemon either that or actually try to make a third with kyurem for the main legendary in the game wwe 2k19 exceeded my expectations the hd graphics  animations are great it’s very user friendly  no technical issues awesome game i’ve been wanting to get it this is my first time playing the wrestling games but i’m enjoying some of the features are difficult to get used to my 10 year son still would rather play 16 or 18 instead also the h3ll in the cell match they did better with breaking the cage but made it harder to do other cage relevant moves another thing ive noticed is they did away with elimination matches and why no ronda or hulk hogan i purchased this game for my son and he loves it he went from not knowing any wrestlers to knowing everything there is about wrestling the only downside is he plays it all the time so i dont get to play my games i bought this for my son for christmas we really enjoy the extra options and better character details bought it for my son for christmas and he loved it ty this is one of the best wwe 2k games of recent years the gameplay feels so much better than it did in 2k18 i bought this on sale at gamestop and i really like it i havent bought a wrestling game in a long time but i am glad i got this one great graphics the moves are easy to pull off even for me get it you will like it i bought wwe2k19 originally for my nephew as a christmas present bit decide to play myself the game plays alot better then the last couple of game enjoyed playing it maybe some of the game is hard to get through but at least the game does not freeze on you or you lose all your saved game like the last two im having fun playing it this is a great monitor for gaming has its 144hz which is fantastic i didnt read what it works best with the worse part is the jog button right after the year warranty the jog button software no longer works right up doesnt work left works down is right and right is down i can get it to work after shutting down and back on spamming the jog button when i managed to get the button to work a reset and did find the software update for it but no go make sure there is no jog button on your next monitor i was absolutely blown away when i first logged into warzone with this baby all of my lag was from my other monitor it really does eliminate lag foa went up by 3040 too thanks samsung you the mvp this monitor reminds me of the imposter and it makes me happy i play amongus on the 240 hz d this product is really great but i dont know how to fix the motion blur and it makes the game look really ugly and it would be really helpful if someon can help me the monitor will not recognize my hdmi signal when computer wakes up  it totally stopped working sent it back for repair and it is doing it again granted this isnt a ultra gaming monitor so it doesnt have amazing specs but its a great value for its price 144 hrz made a big difference my only complaint is that the stand is kind of oddly shaped so it has a hard time sitting flush with my desk all the weight seems to sit at the front of the stand so im confused why it goes back like 5 inches would also be nice if there was some sort of mounting hookup i bought this monitor for my lenovo gaming lap top and since i purchased it here have been playing on it a lot plus i have a samsung telephone and a samsung smart watch as well i have samsung tablet as well but my grandson cracked the screen on it so i rarely use it any more i am very happy with all of my samsung products that i have purchased am looking forward to buying me a samsung big screen  television sometime next year the monitor is great picture is clear and crisp the only reason i gave it 4 stars is the vesa mount holes are inset so not all vesa mounts will fit without aditional hardware i had to go out and buy spacers and longer screws to be able to mount the monitor the vesa mount screws holes should be flush or the monitor should come with appropriate hardware for mounting this review was collected as part of a promotion what an amazing display i just looks so nice when i set it up and connected it to my pc also the refresh rate was amazing i have only ever had a 60hz refresh rate but this looks amazing so this is my

theyre in toys or other bigger products weve always been satisfied about time y’all release a decent violent game  adults play nintendo switch too  i love violence  scary thriller games these little 5 year old games made me want to sell my switch at least doom came somewhat close to what i was looking for honestly its a great game i really havent had any bugs or errors campain and multiplayer make it worth it i freaking love doom first fps and for sure best fps from the gore to the graphics it’s a thriller the whole ride through i’ve bought this game for my xbox and now i bought it for my switch i can’t wait for the second to drop really good game for the graphic system that the switch has this is a 5 star in graphics the story is really good if you switch players love gun games this is a must have in your collection of switch games sometimes the arcade or multiplayer sections go down but beside that the rest is perfect doom is great it suffers due to the limitations of the thumb sticks but one of the best shooters of the generation along the lines of halo gears of war  resident evil really tricky finding everything and leveling up gear a revision of a great classic shooter with awesome fast paced action from start to finish and a good challenge fast paced cool upgrades and a whole lot of action if you like to shoot monster in the face this ones for you really great perobject motion blur that makes the game feel smoother than the 30fps metric lets on now with added gyro aiming the game is a great portable rendition of doom 2016 this game isn’t a shooter like call of duty or like destiny it’s a run and gun type game if you stop moving you die pokemon black is once again a game that will make you want to catch them all the graphics havent changed much and still suck the only thing good about this game is the sound there will be lots of stuff to do and will keep you addicted for a very long time the only people who will want this game are kids ages 512 this is not for hardcore gamers if you want a pokemon game you should get heartgold or soulsilver they are so much better pokemon black is the new installment in the pokemon series its a new start in a new region to encounter new pokemon new gyms and the new legendary pokemon the appeal of the game is amazingly adorable and overshadows the old installments i highly recommend it look nearly everyone is saying all the good things that this game has therefore im going to point out the flaws i love this game and am in no way trashing it im just saying what i dont like about it since everything else has been taken first off they took away most if not all of the puzzles in the game i cant remember one classic strength puzzle in the game which would be impossible considering how big they made the bouldars second theres no big end game dungeon in fact the only good dungeon in the game is only a plot device third theres no big surf area like in hoenn fourth the gym leaders are way too easy only one gave me any trouble and lastly there isnt enough use of the new battle system although when double battles came out there wasnt much use of them i suppose we can expect a pokemon colosseum type game soon for multibattles once again i do like this game im just pointing out the flaws so you know what youre getting into it had better graphics than i imagined i mean did you guyes see how the bridges looked like i love this game it is what it was suppossed to be i have no regrets this is just as good as yellow version this game has quite possibly the best out of all the pokemon enemies team plasma doesnt just wait for you in a warehouse so you can wipe them out they rather go along with the storyline very well only thing i dont like is that sometimes when im in the union room on wifi it doesnt let me do anything at times another thing i dont like is that nintendo couldnt just release the pokemon global link before the game came out or as soon as it did but hey it might come out on wednesday im not a huge pokemon fan but i have to i am quite impressed with this game i loved how the buildings were a 3d looking affect the pokemon battles i have to say this wow its like im actually fighting and the pokemon move in stead of just a picture you know how in the old pokemon games their was a pokemon with just a picture of that pokemon and it would show the text of it does and show like a little animation of how it attacked you well in this it shows the full affect its like i was watching the tv show kind of except playing the game i would recommend people who are not into pokemon give this game a try because it was truly one of the best ones i have ever played the pokemon global link was supposed to be launched on the 30th of march but because of the earthquake in japan it was rescheduled and its new launch will be this wednesday april 13th but for those who do not have pokemon black and whitei feel sorry for you can still try it through a trainer club account online this game is must get it has amazing graphics and a great storyline i loved this game i preordered it and was soooooo happy when it came out i think anyone who has loved pokemon will enjoy it and have alot of fun playng it got it for my daughter for christmas she went to sleep with it on and woke up early to play it again she loves it i brought this game 2 weeks ago and its a great game love it this is an amazing gaming monitor and more  has presets to match the type of game youre playing the movie youre watching or stream youre broadcasting \\nim so glad i purchased this monitor and will recommend it for sure a really exciting game being im a wrestling fan i really enjoyed the look and gameplay of it when this was opened up out of the box it worked fine then a few hours later a single line came down across the screen i was able to send it back and they didnt charge me for it which is nice i get it back and it is working great for a week or so then i hit the printscreen key on my keyboard and that line is there in the same exact spot i checked my cables even took a screenshot and it wasnt there in the screenshot this was a huge disappointment for me especially since it took 2 weeks for the monitor to come back i cant recommend this to anyone knowing that they might experience the same issue either by random chance or one wrong key press ive played both wwe 2k and the smackdown vs raw franchise this 2k is as great as smackdown vs raw 2010 was never buy this monitor jog button that use to  control main menu does not work all the time i have to send it bout again for 2nd time services in just couple months  and you have to wait almost 3 weeks to get it back terrible and big mistake when i bought this monitor another great wwe game dlc wrestlers are cool create a wrestler is still my favorite option game control is the same as in previous titles so its just put it in and play i cant mout this monitor which really sucks every vesa mount ive tried is too big because the area where the mounting plate got is so poorly designed do you have any recommendations for vesa mounts that actually fit to me its like the same game over and over again theyre adding nothing but a new person i can make that person in the creation part so its not worth it im not getting anymore of these games this samsung monitor is a joke  stay away  theyre trying to dump them  after 60 days this went bad out of buying 4  new  screen went yellow and they tried to fix it  takes a month  still not fixed  theyre customer service is another joke  they want you to waste more time trying to get it repaired a second time before they replace it \\n the repair facility in new jersey is another joke  they will waste your time and sell you garbage i’ve bought multiple copies and get the same error dirty disk i bought 2k18 first got the error returned it but they were out so i drove to san jose got a new copy same error went back to san bruno they were baffled suggested i buy 2k19 so i did same error so whatever decent 144hz gaming monitor for the price only problem with it is there is are small but  noticeable pressure mark on the bottom right of the display i would not buy this game at all  i ended giving away cause i did not like the way played  im leaving a 5 star review because this monitor rocks for the price also someone left a review for not being able to mount the monitorthat person must not have known what they were doingeasy to mount just use spacers to clear the shroud not very hard unless you make it hard my son got this from me for christmas and he loves it the monitor is good \\nthe va panel looks great the calibration of colors is great out of the box the curve of the screen is good\\ncant say much about the stand because i use wallmount on my monitors absolutely horrible game  theres a reason why 2k sports is a horrible game maker it has been two week since i purchase and the button powermenu button started to have issue gsync is it working dont know cause i still see break in the image where gsync suppose to smooth it out the menu sometime cant be read turning it off is sometime a pain hi  i purchased this monitor specifically because it is listed as gsync compatible and it is verfied by nvidia as gsync compatible  its great when its close to the refresh rate  however some games that when the frame rates go below 100 or even 120  144hz there is terrible ghosting and blurriness when gsync is on  why is this  if its officially gsync compatible then there should be no ghosting as according to gsync compatibiltiy gsync should work 1240 hz on this    perfect example  in overwatch during the menu screen blizzard caps it at 60fps  there you can see terible purple ghosting on the characters or letters on the menu when they move when they are on a darker background  otherwise during game when you reach high refresh rate to 240hz its fine\\r\\n\\r\\nthe monitor does have excellent colors and contrast and it is indeed fast for a curved va monitor\\r\\n\\r\\n the only way to stop it is to turn off gsync and ghosting goes away  but why should i need to do this  i bought an official gsync monitor to  yes you guess it   use gsync  when will samsung acknowledge this issue with this monitor this review was collected as part of a promotion i really like these energizer max alkaline d batteries energizer max alkaline d batteries work great and i rarely have trouble with them energizer max alkaline batteries are usually my batteries of choice this review was collected as part of a promotion i received the energizer max alkaline d batteries several weeks ago  energizer has been my choice of all size batteries for many years i find these are the longest lasting of all brands i will continue to purchase these for all my battery operated items this review was collected as part of a promotion its energizer not much more to say  always reliable and last a long time for me  this is the first time i have tried the energizer max and so far so good  im expecting great results as with other energizer products  cant go wrong with this brand this review was collected as part of a promotion i recently installed the energizer max batteries into a toy for my granddaughter which i thought was totally shot due to its failure to operate  much to my surprise it is now operating correctly again  good batteries make a difference this review was collected as part of a promotion i tried the energizer max alkaline d size batteries i installed these batteries in my flashlight and dont have to worry about replacing them for over a year the flashlight shines brighter with these batteries i recommend you should replace your brand with the energizer max alkaline this review was collected as part of a promotion when you take the time and effort and expense to purchase batteries the last thing you want is for them to underperform  having no lights when the power goes out not being abel to finish a project or upset grandkids when their favorite toy stops working is the result of a poor battery  my advice is to buy a quality name  the energizer max d2 fits that bill  use itit will last and keep peace in the family  important these days this review was collected as part of a promotion max alkaline d batteries from energizer are nice work for a variety of battery operated household goods easy to put the batteries in and take them out long lasting and help household battery operated goods to run smoothly i would highly recommend these batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion i know the number of items using these larger batteries has gone down over the years i don’t understand why you get so much more life out of these larger cells tired of having to replace aa batteries out of my kids toys so frequently i’m tossed these in one of his racing sets and it’s lasted for a couple of weeks this review was collected as part of a promotion i mean these are batteries so i feel like there isnt too much that can be said about them either batteries are terrible and die rather quickly or they last a really long time ive used this brand before these specific type and we absolutely love them they last forever in our kids toys lamps etc that we use them for if you want to get what you pay for when it comes to batteries these are definitely near the top for the amount of time that they last this review was collected as part of a promotion i really like the energizer max duracell line of products affordable quality batteries for all your battery needs easy to open pancaking energizer is trusted brand in my family and has been for generations this game is surprisingly good i thought that it would have trouble running on the switch but it is turning out to have no problems at all great shooter on the switch runs well and has great graphics soooooo i played this on the ps4 and the sexbox one for whatever reason i just didn’t like it on either platform now that i’m on the switch it feels like the game is custom made for it plus i don’t have to completely destroy my groove because i can take the switch with me it is a great game to have for the switch one of the best shooters to have for any who has issues with curse words you will have no problem with this game not a single curse word is in this game have always been a doom fan and am super hyped for eternal my only issue is graphics rendering and loading  it’s not super slow loading but loads a slight hair slower than a normal console overall for the switch not bad always willing to leave positive reviews in a world of negatives probably the best first person shooter and the best of the doom franchise 9ne player shooting game love this game i almost was unable to play it when you first put the game in it tells you to adjust the screen and i took it far to the left when it was dark and i made the game so dark i couldn’t play it so after two weeks i kept pushing buttons until i found the right one and i adjusted the screen originally played this game on ps4 and was a little afraid of how it would look and run on switch and surprisingly i love this version no map maker kind of sucks but the campaign and arcade mode are great single player fun especially in a time when a good single player fps is hard to find the multiplayer use to not be very good when it first launched but with the free dlc im finding it a lot more fun and a much better experience thats a nice change from the more competitive shooters i normally play its fast paced fun fun for about an hour then becomes repetitive online matchmaking is awkward and buggy and gameplay feels like a brate halo knockoff awesome game it is way better than i was expecting just bought it and its great fantastic screen quality i love it its just perfect i only wish i would have got one sooner this is my first time buying a certified refurbished phone and i am so pleased definitely will do again item arrived in great cosmetic condition however the black line on the screen was not on the description bought refurbished and it has a defective  speaker returning it perfect condition 100 battery life couldn’t be happier went to activate phone with tmobile and was made aware that the phone was reported stolen quite an embarrassing moment gamestop should definitely check the imei before selling it to customers the phone is in good working condition so far there were some scratches on the screen and the phone gets hot sometimes other than that it’s working and looks good awesome phone appears new with 100 battery and flawless appearance really good exactly as advertised battery percentage was at 96 great price product arrived quicker than anticipated exactly as described works great great price fast delivery good packaging its nice to be surprised at such quality and value once in a while i will watch gme for future deals now tons of cool extras and new unlockables etc but the main games issues remain the devs or rather the publisher ea has not done their due diligence in making a special edition the controls remain somewhat unresponsive and the animations suffer with all the new costumes and some of the physics that they undergo i still really enjoy this game despite it absolutely demolishing the force as a concept that is actually the most fun part this turned up to 11 star wars universe is bomb and still a well worthy disc to load in your xbox this halloween i bought this on the 16 of april and had it delivered on the 19 but that isnt the problem the problem is when i went to play it didnt even work and they guaranteed it too so makes no sense so if i may i want a displacement or a refund ive been playing pokemon ever since blue verson the game boy so ive played all the pokemon games that has ever come out i just love the music to this game and the new types of pokemon i really hope you will like it too if you got it wether you get black or white it doesnt matter their both good graphic in both games are really good and i just love the game play i hope they make a pokemon game for the 3ds soon i hope this was kinda sorta helpful enjoy if you do get black or white picture is deceiving may not be in the steel book case rather the cheap gamestop replacement one returned it immediately after finding that out\\r\\n\\r\\nthe game itself is really fun and enjoyable i just recently got this game and fell in love with it as soon as i first played it the new pokemon in this game are very unique this game is very challenging in some parts but everyone likes a good competition this game is the hardest pokemon game i have encountered so far but this can also be a good thing overall this game is a very good pokemon game the force unleashed is magnificent the graphics on the first tfu are good not as good as the second but they are still very good the ultimate sith edition is a great star wars fan collectors item steelcase a card on a character booklet and most of all the dlc is included this game has some time behind it if you may have played the second on before this you wont be disappointed to back track to play this title as the graphics are good controls are the same story line is good and you will put more time in this game in order to beat it than the second if you want the full story of whats going on i recommend playing this one before 2 or you maybe lost as to who is who and how you got where the second one picks up at some of the names in both games are in the movies this game doesnt honestly connect any movies together so dont expect that out of it in all honesty the game is supposedly taking place between star wars 3 and 4 but it doesnt honestly bridge the two great game for kids and adults alike and any star wars fan you can use force powers lightning repulse push and many more to make your way through the stages and defeat the enemies custom customs are available to change your appearance along with sabers multiple colors to choose from and different handles mean different boosts in points health damage etc i recommend this game to anyone who like actionadventures andor star wars in general this is overall a good game the changing of seasons mixes the game up a bit with new pokemon coming or going and with a 100 new pokemon in it no pokemon from any of the other regions will show up the new battle modes changes up the fun of battling and makes it a bit more challenging than the previous titles the graphics a bit sloppy some times but overall a good game first of all for those people who read my reviewsmy reviews are most of the time pretty longbut e3 2011 starts today and i dont want to miss anythingi bought this ultimate sith edition preowned about a year ago and it is a great gamethe only thing that is really bad is that you do the same moves every timethe second swtfu was even worsebut i am a star wars fan and of course i love this gamewell you are probably thinking e3 doesnt start today it started yesterday well it does start todayif you wrote a review before after you write it it says this review can take up to 72 hours to be put up onlinethat is 3 daysso e3 will be on its last daywell read more of my reviews pleasebye gotta watch e3 this game is pretty cool and its nice with its new additions and styles but there are things that are taken away that the gamer will miss mainly the battle tower and the other places instead is a battle subway but theyre mainly all the same different yes but the rules in the battle area places in previous games were more fun take away that and its pretty nice and the story goes along smoothly although i dont like the fac that there are some pokemon not available on black but instead white and vice versa this game is pretty sweet i love that they switch it around and made sith the rulersthe graphics spectacular and the gameplay is awesome the twist of the star wars saga is incerdibly awesome i love the way they made the game and all the detailsi really like the game and i love star warsi recommend you get this game this game is amazing the graphics are beautiful the gameplay is hours on end so much fun and the different ways of interaction and gameplay is refreshing this is by far the best pokemon game yet this is one of the best games i have ever played and i play alot for what i can afford this game had everthing i wanted in a star wars game the sword play and force powers they all rocked i like the extra stuff added to it too playable content made it better  first off i just want to say that this is a game for everyone the more you play it the more fun you will have i have played this game now for about 120 hours and i dont think that will be a fourth of the time i play it for yet at the same time i found that it was great if i only wanted to play for 20 mintues at a time this is a great game for long time pokemon fans and for newcomers to the series no matter who you are i think you should get this game this game is pretty cool it has fun details and good qualityi recommend that you get this game it is a pretty sweet game although the pokemon in this generation may not seem as great as in the past the settings around them fit them perfectly to make them seem a lot better adding onto the 3d cutscenes introduced in heartgoldsoulsilver pokemon black adds many new 3d settings such as more 3d cutscenes 3d bridges and other setting in which you move around in 3d and a beautiful boat ride around a city the only bad thing about this game is the fact that there is an incredibly repetitive story line and not as much to do after the game unlike previous games hopefully dream world will make up for that the trading is a lot better with a notsotedious cutscene that only takes up a few seconds and infared trading is even faster fun little things to do over wifiwireless add to the game play experience and affect your singleplayer world as well with black city which is suprisingly a nice addition to the game overall the game is quite fun but dont expect it to hold you for that long as the game is kind of short but every moment of it will take your breath away with its amazing graphics never before seen on the ds this game is pretty flippin sweet i mean ima star wars fanatic and ican say that i was pleased love the graphics love the force powers and love the signature apprentice style this special edition game is great you can fight luke and obiwan and its a twist on the series as if vader wasnt there all in all good game if your a star wars fan than i recommend it fur sure pokemon blackits a good game with other pokemon dat i dont kno star wars the force unleashed ultimate sith edition is a great game i know that people complain about the length of the of the original game released last year as a major problem this edition has three new levels including the exclusive nondownloadable hoth level so the three extra levels on the second disc gives this game more length and playablility not to mention that you also get extra downloadable content such as the costumes that you could buy online and some exclusive to this edition this edition also comes in a nice steel case with an exclusive artbook and foreward from the creators of the game and exclusive card of one ot the main characters of the game also you get two disc the first is the main game and the second is the extra three levels this is a great deal for the cost of this game this game has incredible graphics my jaw drop a few times because the sights in the game and the details are incredible the sound effects is also awesome not to mention the classic star wars score and the new opening theme is great the only minor problem i have is that sometimes it can be hard to lock on a certain objects to force grip and throw it in a particular direction but other than that the play controls are spot on i also like how they make you build up your force powers in the game that way you can pick which ones that you want to beef up in your order and speaking of force powers i really like how they are over the top in terms of power this is a great game a must buy pick it up the gym leaders are so easy the gym leaders are easy if you choose snivy the graphics on this game is so amazing that i cant even say this review was collected as part of a promotion really if you have kids that play with toys you really cannot beat energizer max batteries  they are hands down the longest lasting by months at least and the most reliable batteries on the market this review was collected as part of a promotion i put the energizer max alkaline d batteries in my flashlight and the light beam is strong and powerful i expect these batteries will last longer than most batteries and i like that because i use my flashlight on a daily basis and need it to be reliable i have always trusted the energizer brand and it has never let me down this review was collected as part of a promotion i love the energizer brand their batteries always outlast any other brand that i buy i use them in many things around my house and they have worked far longer than anything else they work in everything from kids toys to smoke alarms this review was collected as part of a promotion i live in the thick of hurricane country and once you been through one tough storm you find yourself prepping the minute the tropical weather season starts most of the time everything works out ok but ensuring that i have my flashlights ready to go and available in each room of my house is important to me and my weather preparedness has come in handy countless times outside of of storm season knowing that my flashlights and battery operated lanterns have energizer max batteries gives me a lot of comfort while i do my best to check that everything is up to date life happens and my energizer max batteries have never let me down even after being virtually unused for a couple of years  i not only use them in my home but also for my car flashlight an older radio and a megaphone  if youre looking for batteries you can count on to be reliable look no further than energizer max this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries are very well made and are long lasting i have always trusted energizer brand for their products and this is no exception i have been using them in my flash light at our camping trips and they are going solid for at least a month now this review was collected as part of a promotion it’s always good to have a variety of batteries around i used my batteries on a portable fan i have took it camping with me the batteries held up throughout my weekend trip and still going strong reliable batteries that you can’t go wrong with this review was collected as part of a promotion im not sure how much i can say about a battery but they work just as they should i got them to use in my sons swing as a backup battery when i didnt want to use the cord the swing works just as well with the battery vs being plugged in which means there is power behind the batteries he uses his swing often and they havent died yet this review was collected as part of a promotion i like and having and buying energizer batteries because i know that they are reliable and dependable i dont care if it is a new pack of batteries or a pack of batteries that have been in my drawer for a little while i can always count on them to be working they last forever and have multiple different sizes to choose from great price and great design but did not display 144hz without problems tried several different displayport cables with a gtx 1070 that was not overclocked could not push past 85hz settings on pc without red flickering pixels and artifact rma submitted this review was collected as part of a promotion these are strong and powerful batteries that are supposed to be longer lasting so far so good they are working for the time i have had them in a game camera all while holding up in the elements energizer strikes again im enjoying the monitor as a whole like the curve like the 240hz but g sync should not be printed on this monitor it does not work idk if its an adaptivesync issue or a samsung issue but its very misleading this review was collected as part of a promotion i got the energizer max alkaline d batteries 2 pack and they are great the life of them is awesome and i would definitely recommend it to family and friends and i would purchase again for sure in the future overall performance is fine but horrible overshoot with freesync gsync\\r\\n2 months after my purchase got 2 dead pixels false advertising this monitor is not suitable for gaming and 144 hz refresh rate will not help low price poor image quality issues with dp connection no dp cable ghosting has been a huge issue which i  only just now  solved  the solve turn off gsync the problem may be caused by using a amd video card that is just old enough to not have drivers that are able to use the now open source encoding for gsync \\r\\nwhile the colors are fantastic purple is the best example of rich color on this display the refresh rate makes great use of my high end video card and the curve is set to the exact distance for optimal viewing and the contrast is sharp as a knife the ghosting was so bad while gaming and watching movies the monitor was nearly unusable for anything that has high contrast smooth motion  scrolling on web pages showed little to no signs of ghosting at all but motion in gaming was deeply haunted monitor works great at 240 fps very clear and only a little ghosting but not too noticeable in game on games that dip at about 100fps or lower you can get weird imaging issues even with adaptive sync on it is probably due to the screen tearing that would normally be there but adaptive sync is trying to manage so make sure you are changing the graphics settings on games optimal to performance on your pc to use the full 240 fps thats where this monitor will shine obviously \\r\\n\\r\\nva panel looks great blacks are really good the curve of the screen is not too crazy and is actually pretty nice\\r\\n\\r\\nthe stand only lets you have a little vertical tilt no height adjustment i would definitely recommend purchasing a monitor arm to adjust height if you need that this is a high performance slick design monitor its supprisingly  good for the price it can game it stream and it is a great buy the resolution is perfect as well and the 144hz refresh rate is super clean i bought this yesterday for my gaming it is a amazing monitor for gaming the response time is reallu fast i recommend it this review was collected as part of a promotion because habe good resulution and it dont expensive i bought this for my god daughters and they wanted me to join in and play  we have such a fun time together  they were excited to see they could download more characters bought it about a month ago very good game better than last years thats all us fans of the game can ask for is that every year it gets better n thank you for that i was excited to try it but it is slow and laggy while the graphics look great the lack of smooth gameplay kills it great game  much high flying action  my 13 year old cannot put it down if you once loved the grandaddy of the entire fps genre than youve found the right game this game is updated from its original pc roots and much better to play it’s not a horrible game but it’s not great either\\r\\nyour career character can’t be used outside of your career mode and will take a lot more grinding after you finish the career to max out for the online portion of the career mode\\r\\nfor regular characters that you create you’re given unlimited power points but can only do some of the content great graphics challenging and fun to play over all a great game i like the gauntlet match although i rather for my character to be randy orton than aj styles i also like the million dollar challenge the game is very awesome love the graphics and the music is hardcore very cool better than the computer version i dont like not being able to load my own music for the hours i play the game the song selection is small and not diverse enough this game is incredible to have this portable is absolutely on point i hate the control system cant recover from a few hits youre basically getting manhandled by the computer your created character is limited to skills used which makes him weak and in mycareer mode you cant stop the opponent from hitting you no matter how much you hit r2 not to mention reversals dont even work so it makes it almost impossible to get further ahead its almost like wwe only wants you to play with wwe characters terrible game play but beautiful graphics and sound but overall 1 star not worth the money or the stress wwe you need to get your development team together and fix this mess you call a wwe games best games i ever played raw vs smackdown 03 and 04 grafics are great and the game play is awsome brings back memories from when i was younger i have the biggest problem with the story mode the crowd has no reactions to the story line its just always annoying chatter in the background its like crowd isnt even watching the show the game loads after every scene i cant belive we are in 2018 and still have to rely on loading every moment of the game terrible blocking system where in story mode just watch your player get beat up over and over i cant believe this 2019 version of the game did they sleep for a year and said oh 1 week left lets put something togather doom is one of those games that you have to play over and over again i also like playing online its very challenging i can never get bored with this game at all i bought this game cause i like wrestling games  i also bought it for the create features in it  both were excellent fast pace and beautifully rendered with the same level of creepiness that the original game had i was concerned at first playing it on the switch but turned out to be the perfect platform for this game and i would definitely recommend it got this for me i need a game that i havent played yet this is a awesome and brutal shooter the weapons fell great and so is the level desighn the colectables are a bit to mutch for me and they are required to level up youre suit but still a great port for if you want to play doom anywhere solid game  not really my thing normally but glad to have it as a part of my collection  would not have bought digital works great stays charged for a long time charges fast enjoying the new phone so far so good no problems customer service was great the phone has speaker problems it will not let me use with any carrier when i purchased unlocked best deal i could find battery life was fair 93 no scratches or cracks came with usb charger better then nothing beautiful phone we are actually having to return it it says the phone is unlocked but it is still not compatible with our carrier phone came in great condition and so far no issues i bought iphone 12 pro 128gb refurb extremely satisfied on impression looks new only feedback is for delivery services fedex they keep updating the tracking status wrong product claimed to\\r\\nbe refurbished but it was severely scratched and very poorly packaged it is obviously a used product is a nice phone is been a day sense i got it  everything works fine just few visible scratch’s on the screen that i didn’t like  but everything works and runs good it was in perfect condition delivery was flawless exactly what i purchased and thats exactly what i got couldnt have asked for better the phone is overall very good and functions well without problems but there are many visible scratches on the screen that we weren’t informed about on the website i feel like it’s better to just buy a new phone this review was collected as part of a promotion the batteries have been used for a couple of weeks now and not having any issues with the batteries i have used energizer batteries in the past as well and they seem to last a longer than other batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion i live in a very rural area of louisiana we have power outages often especially since the hurricanes this past summer we have to keep a lot of battery powered devices ready to go i used the energizer max batteries in a high powered lantern this usually drains batteries very quickly because its big and puts out a lot of light ive used many brands of batteries but the energizer max batteries are still going strong after a lot of usage with the lantern ill be a repeat buyer this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries were the perfect replacement for my flashlight that was barely working already i forgot how bright my flashlight actually is after replacing the batteries i forgot how batteries actually matter when it comes to the power of the actual light this review was collected as part of a promotion the package says these batteries have a 10 year shelf life but the batteries themselves actually indicate its at least 10 years and 6 months  im using them in a flashlight and theyre working well so far  the real test of a batter is how long they last and i cant comment on that just yet  but so far so good this review was collected as part of a promotion these showed up in perfect timing my husband needed d batteries for a small fan for the military plane he deploys on he said he had it running the entire 13 hour flight and the batteries are still going so i would definitely say they get the job done this review was collected as part of a promotion my family has come to rely heavily on energizer max batteries and these alkaline d batteries are a great example of their consistent quality  these energizer max batteries are equivalent or better in quality as their counterparts  i am very happy with the duration and strength these batteries put out and the energy is dependable  \\r\\n\\r\\ni am always surprised by how light weight and reliable these batteries are  we own a few ‘mag lights also known as policemen’s flashlights that take eight d batteries each  it weighs so much with other battery brands that i simply refuse to use others  i can literally only hold the thing out in front of me for so long before my arm gets crazy tired  with energizer max batteries however the weight is halved and i can hold the flashlight all night  i live out in the rural mountains so a matter such as this is very important to me  we rely on these types of flashlights for our safety out here so they cannot weigh two tons a piece this review was collected as part of a promotion i have a great high beam light but its a battery eater for sure  i have tried to find the best longest lasting batteries for it  i seem to get about a months worth of use from most every other battery we have tried  i have had these in now in the light for over 2 months   life is definetly better when i can see when running i run in the country so its very dark sometimes  not now i can see  this review was collected as part of a promotion we cant go wrong when we go with energizer had to use d batteries for one of our babys toys and im just counting the minutes for this thing to die outhopefully soon the life in these batteries last a long time this review was collected as part of a promotion these chonky bois pack a punch they better considering how massive they are there arent too many devices that use d batteries but the ones that do sure appreciate the power in these energizer max d batters this review was collected as part of a promotion i think that these energizer max batteries are the best they last longer than most batteries do they work great and the flashlight i put them in is bright so i know they are doing their job i will be buying them again this pokemon game is an okay game it was a bit better than the previous ones but not much they have different screen shots and stuff and new features there were lots of new pokemon and a chance to catch the legendary pokemon victini if you buy it before april 10 i dislike how it is nearly impossible to catch victini i got his health so low you could barely see it about 1 and he still wouldnt stay in the pokeball i like how the games on the website are located to appeal to your money balance pokemon black was a very great game and i was impressed but it lacked perfection i liked that in diamond and pearl the climax was before the eighth gym and the pokemon league this way you could train your legendary pokemon during the pokemon league this would help a lot in this game espescially since reshiram works good against the elite four if they made another pokemon game in the future it might be better if they put the climax before the eighth gym this game also felt shorter than others i dont have heartgold or soulsilver so i dont know how long the story is but if you look at platinum its a lot harder than black black also seems easier especially since you dont have to complete the unova pokedex to get the national pokedex you may not agree with me but i dont think pokemon black is the best that it can be although its extremely close this game is a great game for the ds console game this new pokemon game is a big step from the other pokemon games gamefreak put alot of effort to make this game from the graphics sounds gamplay and staying true to what it isthis game is great for all types of gamers kid and casual gamers can playthrough the epic storyline but there is another part of pokemon people dont really see while in your journey you can trade with your friends or actually trade with other people in the world with wifi pokemon has a competition side to and more complex than people thinks whether its just an average or competitive gamer this game appeals to all and there is so much thing to explore i wouldnt be suprised if this wins many awards it was a pretty goood game it was much better than nintendos last few games but there are a few problems first it is short by pokemon standards also they could have done better music like not using a computer but if you ignore the music and just play it is pretty awesome also i like how you are required to capture reshiram this game is perfect newgraphicspokemon and the legendarys ofcourse i recoomend this gme to all kids ok i have to admit the nips did pretty good on this one i recomended it to all my friends and we battled a few days ago so i love this game and play alot so i think that that this game would be good for gamers around the age of 612 so thats my review so good luck and happy pokeballs pokémon black version is the absolute best game i have ever played hands down the graphics are great for the ds and there is a very wide variety of pokémon i would recommend this game for kid and casual gamers this i think is one of the best rpg pokemon games out the graphics are fine the soundtrack is really good and it makes you flinch once you see the average house pet it is a great game dont get me wrong the pokemon in this game is really childish since the pokemon dont look as good as the other ones also the starter pokemon are the worst i have seen out of all the other games the 3 on 3 pokemon battle just ruins it because you can just gang up on one opponent and knock him out which ruins it other then that it is a good game the action was on point every hit shot and kill felt intense the music was noteworthy and believe the game strays away from average triple a games and marks it self as one of those good callbacks aside from the controversial multiplayer that is a mix of halo and call of duty with the loadouts which is new to the doom series yes i am old school purist when it comes to the old school doom multiplayer but while it is quite convenient to just have doom on your switch on the go the game does have to suffer a bit in the technical department so you wont get those sweet 60 frames per second which is crucial because you got alot of demons to kill and you cant have less than 60 due to all the things go on   also same as the other xbox ps4 and pc platforms the game play is too restricting in my opinion  also there is no snapmap mode so you can forget about creating maps   and lastly the multiplayer is again just a mix of halo and cod riddled with loadouts because its too difficult for millennial to actually find weapons on the map and the demon runes are truly unnecessary and all it is just a crutch to help a losing team win   back in the old school days all you had on you was a pistol and 50 rounds for it so youd either find weapons armor and whatnot or else you were a dead man  other than all that its an okay game on the switch this game is almost too fun extra gory and immediately satisfying music is very fitting and the journey is enthralling to the end great game definitely different playing it on the switch very unique game kids love it they get a kick out of the bfg9000 this is copy number 2 one per kid d game was eeehhh repetitive and static one of the few shooting games on the switch but i didnt like it doom is easy to play and lots of fun one of the better games i’ve purchased for the switch this was my frist time playing the doom series its a fun game however i wish the mechanics were better with the gun play like the aiming and such and it feels way too short for a 60 game its the best of the best \\r\\nbeing able to slay the evil on the go is exhilarating pretty impressed how well it works on the nintendo switch love this game didn’t like it it’s all the same as last year the story line is okay i love to storytelling and the new wrestlers all together great game ive been buying the whole series of wwe since the beginning of playstation making these games my opinion this new 2k 19 is very glitchy slow then passed game pre 2013 was game play fluid the newer games after that may have better graphics but gameplay severely slowed and glitchy i feel like i would like to return it but im a fan of the wwe so i cant no matter how bad it iswish the developer would understand that  this 2k19 version is pretty good it’s very realistic and challenging a overall good solid  game i bought this for my sons birthday  he loves it i bought about this game for my nephews about 2 weeks ago safe to say they were not pleased with it it’s been a little over a week since they last played it and i see no interest from their part to play the game again some people may love this game but i don’t think we will purchase another wwe game again madden  fifa still get played daily with them  only bad things i see is that the story should have more branches win this happens loose this happens and other things in your story should have out comes on other matches run ins pick a fight so on and so forth go after different championships like ps1 wwe games did or wm 2000 i bought this two weeks ago and i am very impressed i am enjoying the myplayer mode immensely as well as the universe mode the wwe 2k games have been games i have stopped getting into after 2k15 the reason mainly was that i personally didn’t like the whole trying to be as realistic to what you see live on tv i loved games like wwf no mercy smackdown here comes the pain wwe day of reckoning ect the reason i loved those games was because it was pretty easy to get into and it wouldn’t take long for people to get use to the controls so when i finally got my copy of wwe 2k19 i was excited because i can play as wrestlers from the current wwenxt roster but i was also worried that the controls would be something would keep me from enjoying the game thankfully i grew to really enjoy this game even though there are some things keeping it from being great\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nin past wwe games there were story modes that either were original stories made by the developers or the story mode would be a simulation of past wrestling moments like the attitude era this time around the games story mode revolves around current wwe superstar daniel bryan the story mode shows a lot of moments of his career like one of his first matches in wwe when he went by the name bryan danielson to his big main event matches with john cena at summerslam for the wwe championship and the triple threat match between him randy orton and batista at wrestlemania 30 i really got into this story mode mainly because i am a fan of daniel bryan plus it was really cool to see all of his big matches replicated in video game form and a lot of the scripted moments during those matches were great it felt like i was really rewatching the matches it was simulating i really dont have an issue with the story format 2k is taking with these games but the story mode was pretty short i think it would have been better if there were 2 more wrestlers getting to same treatment someone that comes to mind is the coverboy himself aj styles could have gotten the same treatment\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nas for the gameplay which was my biggest concern walking into this game is pretty much a more technical game but it still is pretty easy to get into if you have played some of the wwe smackdown vs raw games the only added feature is the payback abilities which is something you can trigger during a match that can either give you a finisher stock or if there is a moment you know it will be hard to break a pin or submission you can use the resiliency ability and you automatically kick out of a pinsubmission there are a lot of abilities in this game and each superstar has something that fits their character the way you can use payback abilities is by filling up a bar which can only be filled if you are fighting and when the time is right payback abilities can help save you in a lot of situations\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\nother added features to this game include match types like 5 man match types more match types for 6 man matches and now 8 man matches looking at 8 man matches specifically it ran pretty well i didn’t feel like the game was running slow because of all the wrestlers on the screen at the same time there were a lot of times when the game would glitch during matches like the elimination chamber where sometimes characters would stretch as if they were mr fantastic or one of bailey’s wacky waving inflatable tube man and while it was funny to see sometimes it did happen a couple of times and i hope things like that get patched\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\n\\r\\noverall wwe 2k19 was a game i really enjoyed playing and i’m glad i dont need to rely on past wrestling games as my only way to play wrestling games i wanted to play a really good wrestling game with wrestlers that i watch on tv or with the help of wwe creation in 2k19 people can make wrestlers from other companies like new japan tna roh ect and later upload the characters they made online and people can download them so they can be added to their games and a lot of the created wrestlers people have made are fantastic and could have easily have passed as playable from the get go wwe 2k19 is a really good time and while there are some improvements that can be made to it like adding more stories to go through it was great to play a solid wrestling game ok so i havent really dived into the game yet but i did check out a few things it had to offer  one of the things i do like is in the menu they actually separated male wrestlers from female wrestlers the reason why i like this is because female wrestlers can not face guy wrestlers and sadly enough male wrestlers outnumber female ones on the game 5 to 1 if that so having to scroll through a super long list of male wrestlers just to find the females to decide which ones i want to throw into the match was very annoying  note i do not know if this feature was in wwe 2k18 as i only played the switch version for a small amount of time due to obvious reasons but if it was they im glad they kept it that way  otherwise im glad they added it nice to finally see jar jar in the black series line hes a well made figure with good articulation and modeling even if you’re not a jarjar fan this figure looks amazing on the shelf amazing detail and a must have great job hasbro the pgone was exactly what my daughter wanted it was in like new condition she is very pleased with the purchase theyre not technically lying here but the term certified refurbished generally means that the product is certified and refurbished by the manufacturer so i feel kinda mislead if theyre using the same terminology as apple they should have the same standards 85 battery health is a big disappointment what exactly was refurbished if such an obvious thing as the battery was not this is just a used phone that has been cleaned and hopefully tested does the 1 year warranty cover a new battery you get what you paid i got my iphone one week ago and i haven’t gotten any problem the condition of the phone was really good i was scared about the battery but i checked it it was great this phone is awesome i’m very happy with my purchase the phone is a pretty blue and the camera’s great thanks phone came right on time nothing was wrong at all everything was super easy to set up and it works just like it’s suppose too no cracks or scratches either great service and customer service thou phone number on website needs to be updated it’d have been great to get earbuds with the phone but the quality it’s great so no complains i’d definitely use game stop again i returned the products was not what i was looking for the exterior shipping box looked like it was ran through a paper shredder not gss fault interior shipping box was also trashed very little protection for the phone withing though it survived shipping 35 as far as certified refurbished not sure what certified means to gs or whoever is handling their refurb process the iphone itself is maybe 710 cosmetically clear signs of having been dropped screen and back are pristine rear camera lenses have some minor scratching battery life is reported at 100 which is to be expected given its a newer model functionality seems to be 100 so aside from cosmetic issues and the shipping box being destroyed everything looks good looks brand new a on the quality 100 battery health too i received this phone refurbished and it looked brand new even though the rating was good not excellent it has performed beautifully with no issues whatsoever would definitely buy another product from gamestop always have different outcomes based on your decisions plus a great begging to a series of games to come it is scary and challenging i already beat it but are going to play it again to see if i can get different results im going to do the same thing with the 2nd game in the series that i beat and will see if i can get different results i cant we sit to try the 3rd one in the series phenomenal gameplay and story with multiple endings its a great game with many possible that allows for a different ending each play through i enjoyed the multiplayer aspect my boyfriend and i enjoyed playing this game together the graphics characters and gameplay is good would recommend this game doesn’t live up to supermassive’s “until dawn” this game is extremely boring and not scary at all the few attempts it makes to scare you just aren’t scary it all takes place mainly on an old ww2 ship it could have been so much more scary it doesn’t have nearly as good of a setting as until dawn the game just doesn’t seem polished or maybe even finished this game and “little hope” are both this boring and not scary hope supermassive takes a note from these bombs to create something much better the next time around it’s also only 4 hours long and not worth the price definitely don’t recommend reminded a bit of until dawn but love it either way i love these game makers and their recent game man of medan was all i had expected and more great game quality and the horror and thrillers in the game are well thought out and not cheesy you can tell that they put in the time while creating those game supermassive game makers have outdone themselves again i highly recommend this one and then their previous games leading up to this one it’s a great solo game as well as multiplayer if you take turns with friends or family it isnt as good as until dawn and feels fairly short bit but overall a decent game this is the follow up game to until dawn and plays essentially the same way you make decisions from 3 choices in a timed format or click the right button on a qte any and all characters can die and theyve added a coop and sharable game mode if you liked until dawn you will like this as well this review was collected as part of a promotion i have been using these energizer max alkaline d batteries 2 pack for a few weeks now in a flashlight that i use inside and outside for various chores that sometimes require a little light theyve stood up very well  good stuff this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer max batteries are so much better than regular ones these d batteries last longer than regular d batteries they have a 10 year shelf life making them perfect for storing i like to buy lots of different sizes of batteries and keep them on hand for emergencies like hurricane season with energizer max i know my batteries will stay fresh that makes them dependable and i appreciate it this review was collected as part of a promotion ive been using energizer batteries for years  i always have flashlights on hand in case of power outages  and worry that my d batteries for flashlights will be dead just when i need them most the energizer max are supposed to last for years so i really wanted to try them i will say that my flashlight shines brightly and so far works great since ive only had them for a short time its hard to give a 5 star and thats the only reason for a 4 star this review was collected as part of a promotion once i received these i immediately put them into a game we have that requires this size battery we played all night 2 nights in a row and they held up pretty well they havent died yet but the power doesnt seem to have went down at all and no skipping in power which sometimes happens with batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion i trust the energizer max brand batteries especially for things like my flashlight that needs to be working when necessary  i have never been let down by energizer and these batteries are supposed to last for a long time which makes them perfect for my needs this review was collected as part of a promotion i have always used a different batteries but i never will use them again these are the bomb i put these in my flameless candles and they shone so bright they were actually brighter will recommend to everyone i know this review was collected as part of a promotion i got these batteries because i needed some for my flashlight i was shocked that these made the light brighter and i know with this brand they will last for a while i recommend getting these batteries for emergency use this review was collected as part of a promotion i needed new d batteries as the competitor batteries i used before died quickly these energizer max batteries are awesome theyre powerful and have a long lasting battery will definitely be buying more of these for the next time i need new batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion we put these batteries in our kids large remote control carand it’s still going strong after weeks of use our kids use it lots during the day usually i have to change the batteries once every week but these have outlasted the others we use we are getting more of these as backup yay for long lasting batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion i used these batteries for my babys swing and i have had no problems with it they came in handy and the battery life lasts for a while there were times that i forgot to turn the swing off but the batteries have not died yet it’s a nice wallet i picked it because batman is a great superhero he’s my favorite superhero fits a lot of credit cards i have played every version from red to black and pokemon black  white is by far the best story to date the pokemon are unique and fresh and well thought out the game play is smooth no glitches whatsoever the new graphics are crisp an streamline and the battle mechanics work well with the touch screen this game will bring back pokemon lovers of old and usher in new ones bravo and thank you pokemon company i love this game very addictive one day i played it for at least 12 hoursgraphics are awesome for a ds gamei beat this last saturday and the pokemon i have areserperior lv74reshiram lv57cinccino lv54unfezant lv52zoroark lv64and last but not least simipourlv65 i also love the new gyms especially the fourth one in nimbasa city which is a roller coaster if you like the ds than this is the right game for you this game rocks you gotta get it with good graphics and everything get this and the stuff i recommended below what are you waiting for get it now i love this game the graphics are great but some of the people say that nintendo and gamefreak are running out of ideas but if you look at it this way those pokemon were new to the trilogy wich make it a idea so all i have to say is pokemon is the best game in the world loved the games so awesome amzinggg i love it i got pokemon black and my brother got pokemon white  this game is the boss i cant believe i even have it the way its so cool i love this game so bad in less than one day im at the seventh badge the way its so addicting its so addicting that im even playing it now this game is the best game i have ever played for the pokemon trilogy i mean blue was great but black is the bomb i went to the big city and it has 3d graphics are amazing when i turned my ds on for the new game i was suprised at the 3d graphics the starters are powerful the gym leaders were kinda hard but still easy i love the elite four there challenging but you need to get cobalin virizion and terrakion or the elite for will be harder so good luck this is by far the worst pokemon released so far i mean normally you get a pokemon game and keep playing and playing i could only play one day before i put it down it sucks walking is stupid and the battles are overly hard if you plan on getting it wait unil the price drop if youve played any of the other pokemon games like me youll be amazed by this one the starters are powerful the legendaries are wonderful and the elite four is actually challenging most definitely my favorite game of 2011 still an old fan  first person shooter fan  good old classic at first i was doubting this game because it’s for the switch and i have it for the ps4 but after playing it on the switch i didn’t notice anything different if you thinking about getting it and haven’t play it yet then go for it you not going regret it good to great i think to play this high graphics game to a on the go console not exact the same graphics as on the pc and ps4 but yeah its good love the layout of the game and the graphics are excellent  i could play this for hours on end who doesn’t love the all time classic doom when i was little i was terrified of the doom created in the early 2000’s but now that i’ve grown up playing this game has been a great expierence and a bit different from your common shooters the graphics on table top mode is good not great if you want to to see something that’s far it’ll be blurry fps is not bad on table top once it’s docked there are no problems you might want the fix the x axis default sensitivity it’s pretty high besides the fact that this game running on switch is an amazing technical achievement the game is excellent and the gyro controls while not quite on par with a pc mouse are fun to use once you get used to them can’t put the game down once you get started especially since you can take it with you anywhere very fun action  gets a little repetitive over time but doesn’t lose the enjoyment pretty good game for a switch game that was made for the ps4 and xbox it has good graphics for it being on the switch i purchased this game on friday and i cant stop playing it especially with my favorite wrestler roman reigns on there also great game it’s literally a copy with the only change being a different menu screen so far good but have only had it a week so still getting the hype of newness i bought the game a couple of weeks ago  not extremely impressed  no real changes from older design career story is great trading card and thway you increase your stats is just dumb and story you might have to do over matches over and over before you can move on zero replay ability i just bought it and can’t dtop playing it every chance i get  this title is very good  better than 2k18 bringing back the limbs system great  don’t know why he took it out to begin with  good fun with friends and online is way fun i say way better then last year game graphics are solid voice acting is terrible as is my career 2k locking everything behind lockboxes is also a waste i brought this game and i love the build quality and graphics they put a lot of detail in this game glad they brought back showcase mode this years myplayer is way better than its been in past years and the towers game mode is a good addition 2 thumbs up 2k i loved until dawn and seeing that this was by the same creators quickly bought it but it felt a lot shorter than ud and the ending was pretty lack luster i don’t know if it’s cause of my ingame choices but yeah ill start by saying this game had great graphics  it was really detailed and was probably the only good part about this game  \\r\\ni was really excited to play this game because i loved until dawn  i finished the game in less than a day and honestly this game is complete trash compared to until dawn  i was expecting a lengthy game with a good plot but i got a short game with a horrible plot  \\r\\nthe game had so many glitches and bugs  my screen would freeze and id miss quicktime events  the jumpscares were average  there is no closure on the plot you never find out what happened on the ship  after all the action in the beginning of the game youd think they would give you an explanation as to what happened but there wasnt any closure whatsoever  the game was completely rushed and after i finished i was honestly a little bit mad that i wasted money on this  they couldnt have put less effort into a game  i would not recommend this game  if you want to watch it i suggest you watch pewdiepie play it  that way you wont waste your time i bought this game because i really enjoyed “until dawn” the concept is cool that the game is two player and you each control different people but something about the story wasn’t appealing to me i just wasn’t feeling it for those who loved other games by supermassive games until dawn hidden agenda this is just as amazing so scary i haven’t finished playing it because i’m a wimp lol this game really does let you change the game based on your choices ran thru it in about 4 hours but a good play hard choices hard on the psychetakes away from the overall game enjoyment\\r\\n\\r\\nvisually the game is great the mood is proper as is the plot i recommend adjusting the reaction time and quicktime event settings because not all of us have razorsharp reflexes \\r\\n\\r\\noverall it feels like a choose your own adventure style and is fun if the settings are made proper for your playstyle interesting game great for groups of friends more like an interactive movie than a game the game has a great story  the game has some very intense moments and definitely pulls you in as you play spooky fun and great to play with family or friends it has jump scares a decent storyline and the narrator just adds to the overall ambiance that you are playing in a horror game it is not actionpacked per say but very strategic you have to think and make hard decisions without a lot of time to do so which can be super stressful and keeps you on the edge of your seat the twist in the story is also well executed so i cant wait for the next installment as well as to replay the game at first the controls and the general gameplay seems a bit awkward but it makes sense after you get further into the game the general plot is interesting kind of like a modern twistaplot book from the 80s thats honestly the best part of this game is the element of changing now comes although theres the usual plot line limitations the character relationships are immature for my taste being in my forties but for the younger generation i guess its normal for them i think with a smoother flowing more plausible plot this game series would be excellent the graphics are absolutely engaging this review was collected as part of a promotion i received energizer batteries in the mail they work great and its from a brand i can trust batteries are not cheap and it gets

energizer family i have been buying energizer batteries all my life it is the only\\r\\nbrand i count on for electronics to lighting this battery holds its charge and is reliable in times of need especially flashlights and lanterns they have on the package 10 year shelf life i have had some energizer batteries that have lasted longer i am sure this one will too you guys sell banged up packaging  meaning either the person that ships is careless and us mint on box collector’s suffer after paying for something brand new this figure is great but you guys should handle your packaging better great figure for a fairly unknown character as most collectors focus on mcu known releases it is good to still have a deep comic book connection better as a collectors item then to open it up right away its a nice figure for a char i have never heard of like the look and how they put it together my brother wont stop talking about this game he cant wait if you love all the other pokemon games and actually read the story youll love this one as expected the game has pulled all the stops on the graphics the city is so large that the 3d effects makes you get lost in the city and when you try to catch a pokémon the poké ball is actually in 3d too so you see the ball shake at an aerial view the game changes season every month so youll be exploring the whole region for secret areas that normally you couldnt access in a certain season also as the seasons change certain pokémon are more common in certain seasons than others and now you dont need to go to a pokémon center to play multiplayer thanks to infrared technology you just point the games at each other and you can have a battle right away and the new ways to battle like triple and rotation battles you need to think what youre opponent will do before you make a move and there are many new things in the game too but i am not going to say any more spoilers so get yourself the game and enjoy what the new game has to offer ether black or white the stories are the same except one area in the region is different in one version than the other just get it play it and enjoy it this game is absolutely fantastic the new graphics are nothing short of gorgeous and the all the new gameplay elements work well and contribute greatly to the gameplay experience the only real flaw i can find is that the music is still the same chiptune as always id appreciate some real instruments next time round i preordered it the first time i heard about his game it has the best graphics yet there is so much to do now there is rotation battlestriple battles the music hall the battle subway and much more i cant wait until the dream world comes out on march 30th thats gonna be awesome im already at the 7th gym leader and i caught the 2 of the 3 legendary trio which is cobalion and virizion i still have to catch terrakion i got victini also its a very good pokemon to have on your team i love this game so much i recommend it to any pokemon lover from little kids to adults this game was amazing and is pefect for anyone being a person who has played pokemon ever since red and blue came out i think that this was the best pokemon game that i have played because of the cool graphics gameplay and over 150 new pokemon to catch and train i have played many pokemon games and i think this is the best yet this game has the best graphics in pokemon ever compared to the past pokemon games i have played this game every day since it came out and i think you could pick this game up and love playing this game every single day if you dont believe me the buy a copy for yourself \\ue405  ohs yea this rules the new graphics are good the pokemon are really fun to learn the gyms arepretty easy actually the story line is really  really epic i like that u have 2 rivals biancacheren 2 battle this is just so amazing and addicting  bye now im gunna get back to playing it  the game was ok the pokemon are not a garbage bag a ice cream cone its like they are running out of ideas theres also too much added to the game such as dream world and extralink i would not recommend this game to new pokemon players story right from the start the big cinematicanime intro is based on a character that isnt you yep and the story is pretty slow at the beginning team plasma is closely related to the pokemon version of peta only they still use pokemon to battle with one thing that is new is that your rivals are actually involved throughout the game and not just in certain parts overall okay but not great gameplay pretty much another pokemon game wo new pokeballs youve got 150 brand new pokemon and thats it so a big throwback to the kanto region i did find some of the new attacks and abilities interesting but thats a given with any new generation the xp system is different too instead of fixed amounts pokemon level up depending on the level gap between other pokemon this makes it a bit more challenging and is one of its strongest points miss the touch interface emphasis from hgss but its still present the cgear is cool and other goodies make it stand out from the previous versions graphics many pokemon are not very appealing or original and the few that are can be a lot of fun to use there is a lot more 3d influence in this game and the various camera angles and field designs are really impressive this is another one of the games strongest points i wish they didnt trade so much clarity of the pokemon designs for movement they looked really good in hgss sound its an okay score not bad or great some tunes are catchy but overall okay interesting how certain elements in the game cause changes to the soundtrack lasting appeal was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the game but not blown away definitely a must for pokemon fans but a little sketchy for little kids though the battle system is relatively the same leveling up isnt i doubt that they will get through the game easily with just a lv 70 emboar in my opinion this is pretty much the same game as the previous year as far as gameplay goes just with an updated roster the tower mode is alright my favorite feature of the game is reliving daniel bryan’s career since he is one of my favorite wrestlers superstars i ended up selling the game before trying the career mode so i can’t say anything about that for being able to run on the switch this game is so awesome every year wwe 2k premieres its new game new game only thing that changes are some characters add a few moves and new my career story this years is no different i like the story mode starting off in the indy circuit but you really have no control over your character and life like last years my career and i wish they would let you customize your character from top to bottom whats with the name buzz and you cant create your character to match the name great game but im probably too old to really get into it i played a fair amount of the original pc game and im sure this one would grow on me since the graphics are pretty amazing and the game play is intense but it was a bit too gory to have around my kids so i returned it and got zelda botw and smk8 if youre into fastpaced intense shooters then this wont disappoint i have to admit my eyes just arent what they used to be and it was tough for me to play on the tiny switch screen i cant really rate how a major gamer would see this one but for what its worth it was one of the best games ive ever played for what my expectations were before i bought it i think maybe someday id like to buy it again but for now it was a bit much im not a huge video game player and you would need to immerse yourself in it to get the full experience ive just got too much adulting to deal with i cant knock the game for anything i would highly recommend it just bought this for my son and he absolutely loves it the best fps on the switch i have not stop playing this game since i got it love the story mode and the multiplayer so fun and fast paced i love games with a good storyline and this new mycareer is the best one yet sure there is room for more improvement but its definitely the best ive seen in years this game is well worth the money great homage to the original doom plays very well on the switch great game career mode provides so many challenges and there’s always something to do i had purchased this game because i have it for the ps4 so i was more less expecting the same idea but i pretty much got the same package i praise the switchs gimmick the ability to move your switch around and play in a somewhat vrlike experience with 360 fps\\n\\nhowever the big point that sent me running for the hills was the myltiplayer its current status is practically dead no pun intended and not good in anyway whenever i would jump into onlinemultiplayer i would spend about an hour or so just waiting maybe getting lucky with a match  the only way i could play online for sure is if i get invited or invite someone to my party but unless you have many friends with the game dont expect too much out of the multiplayer aspect unfortunately this was a big driving point  reason i had to return the game i did not want to rate the game one star for this reason however as i fear that would be unjust and unfair to the game as a whole \\n\\n3 stars i bought the game a few days after it came out and i glad i did if you like fast paced adrenaline fueled combat this is your game i bought this a few weeks ago and my kids love it so much they played it day and night absolute masterpiece there was nothing that could feed my lust for the blood of all the demons in hll wow gamestop way to censor an actual location in the game until i found this game soundtrack is amazing and keeps the bloodlust pumping i got this days ago and it better then the old games expect smackdown here comes the pain sort of hard to learn to play but still an awesome game great game better graphics needs a womens my players mode and gm mode still a frantic shooter experience on the switch although the graphics arent as good as the xbone framerate held steady during the most hectic fights and it was amazing to have a consolefps experience on the go i am so glad i brought this game my only complaint is the unlock system i like doom if you dont like doom i dont like you one of the most intracate and challenging games i have ever played  so much to do with a unique imaginative and captivating story line gameplay worth it the game is great and i love it the first disc i bought was dirty and chipped gladly the store let me return it and get a new copy the service was good but it’s never fun to buy a broken game this is a great game my son usually completes an entire game in about 2 days but not this one my nephew loves the game he played it everyday until he reached the end the look on his face when he received the game was the best if i ask for a ps4 game dont give me the xbox version of it i like how it pays take me to homage to fallout 3 it contains history of boston and old tv show cheers love the ga i bought this for a christmas gift exchanged it as it wont work same issue next disc gotten several other games us only this one that has given issues  internet is full of forums with same issue none of responces help many others same problem neither disc had so much as a scratch dont waste your money or time is not a gamestop issue or ps4 issue as bethesda website claims i bought this just over a month ago what a disappointment to have it opened as a christmas gift and it doesnt work i tried contacting gamestop to exchange it but no response since christmas great game experience great franchise need more titles like thisvery pleasant gamestop experience as well so sick and got it at a good price for it being preowned ive always wanted to get into fallout and due to my console this is where i started definitely recommend the quests are easy to follow and game is pristine game comes with case and instruction booklet im going to start off by saying that i am a big fan of these types of games ever since heavy rain i love story driven games and the ones that have mostly quick time events usually have this element however i was kinda let down by this one i really enjoyed until dawn so i was excited but this didnt have everything i wanted for the most part i felt extremely board with the story i honestly was not very interested it seemed like a very safe go around and thats what the game was so if your a fan of this game type you will probably like it but dont go in hoping for too much some of the redeeming qualities were the introduction of being able to play with friends and how you would get to choose your characters overall the game was meh but hopefully they get the next one right game would not load past the main title screen reinstalled checked for updates but still would not play really enjoyed until dawn and thought this looked to be a very similar experience  though the storytelling wasnt quite as good as until dawn it was still quite enjoyable nonetheless  quite spooky  definitely recommend a play through yeah the cinematics are great and it is legit scary but i recommend don’t actually try when you play it the “premonitions” you get suck and you’ll find out they tell you nothing the secrets suck too also quick button mashing determining death stupid any could get killed easy at any time little within your control if you don’t care who dies and when sure play it ive been craving to play another game as gripping as until dawn and the man of medan does just that this game is the best of gameplay and suspenseful movie wrapped into one and i cannot wait to play the next game in the dark anthology series i like the writingbut quicktime events determining if characters live or die is kind of frustrating  i also noticed characters that died in subsequent cutscenes which was somewhat jarring  i think that perhaps the dev team would be better served toning back the choice portion of the game for better storytelling they certainly have talent but the above flaws made me shelve the game before finishing the game itself is buggy while going through cutscenes and gameplay affects the enjoyment i have for the game lack of continuity of characters personalities and dialogue not an action game its a decision based game pretty good for what it is  but the game stop employees in oroville are the best they are very knowledgeable an helping loved it  watching a movie where your decisions keep everyone alive or kill some or maybe them all this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries are great for providing reliable power to everyday household products the shelf life of up to 10 years from these batteries is extraordinary i used this product for my flashlights and so far these batteries performed exceptionally well during extended hours the overall battery design is innovative and you can tell that this is a leading brand that people trust great quality and value all in all these will definitely come in handy for all of your electronics this review was collected as part of a promotion i love my trash can but the downside of owning a batteryoperated handsfree can is the number of batteries you go through rechargeable batteries are the end goal but for now i am still using singleuse and these are truly the best there are competitor brands that are good too but these honestly seem to last the longest i am constantly triggering the top when i walk past let alone how much i throw things away its really nice that i dont feel like im going through these quickly i hate to think of the cheaper batteries that just end up in the landfill before even really getting much use these are worth every penny this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer max alkaline d batteries last longer than other batteries i have purchased in the past very happy with my energizer max alkaline d batteries and will purchase again in the future an d recommend to others this review was collected as part of a promotion you cant go wrong with any energizer max product and

only work but are very bright this review was collected as part of a promotion its reassuring energizer max is there when you need it i went for the flashlight when the lights went out last nite and

batteries work great i keep these in my flashlight and fishing aerators they are very powerful and last forever i rarely need to change them use these if you want to be able to depend on your batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer max alkaline d batteries are always great and we have no complaints they are long lasting and affordable with two kids at home and multiple toys in need of batteries at any given time we always keep energizer batteries on hand i would definitely recommend these this review was collected as part of a promotion i loved using these d batteries because they last longer i would recommend it to my family and friends i used mine in my lantern and it runs very good the light is bright and stays lit for longer times i used emboar the whole game thats how easy it was the whole game was practically emboar using head smash i think that its a good game but the old pokemon games are more fun also this is really short for a pokemon game i beat it in 3 daysi mean it was fun but too short and really easy also get white its better dont make the mistake i did this game is a very entertaining game and it has a lot of lasting appeal as to finish the national pokedex youll have to put a lot hours on your game i own both black and white and from my point of view white is a better game because you can catch more pokemon in white because of white forest if youre more of a trainer than a collector id recommend black because it has black city black city has a lot of trainers this games plot as well as whites are improved from previous games as team plasma the bad team has a goal besides stealing pokemon great game by far the best pokemon game ever the graphics are amazing 3d citys are just cool not going to lie to you its a good game but soulsilver and heartgold are still the 2 best pokemon games on the ds which is a remake got new pokemon new storyline the game play is good graphics are good the new pokemon are better looking than diamond pearl and platinum pokemon the storyline will have you drawn in wanting you to keep playing to see what comes next into the game the down fall is no verse seeker which makes it harder to raise up your pokemon the other con is cant trade between older ds pokemon games and blackwhite so youll have to transfer them all over again like in platinum diamond an dpearl which they had a reason to do that but black and white doesnt the transfer needs to ds systems and when you transfer youll have to shoot pokeballs at the pokemon and its timed time runs out the pokemon go back to their respective games i dont like the transfer in this game graphics are nice theyll be the 1st thing youll take notice to from the way the towns look to pokemon battles sound could have been a bit better same sounds as the other ds games controls are simple youll get used to them fastlasting appeal will as soon as you beaten the game oyull want your other pokemon from your older ds pokemon games get it but dont expect it be as good as soulsilver or heartgold though 9 out of 10 well worth your buy i have 6 badges now and i am very glad i bought the game it very is fun the graphics are awesome they really revamped the battle system as well i would recommend this game to any new player to pokemon or long time players like myself the music is very nice to and there is some ways to change but just a little overall the game is great and i have a feeling i will be playing this game for sometime it was great i beat it the first day this games is allright but at first the storyline is kinda boring i wish that they didnt upgrade the graphics so muchit seems its more complicated then old pokemon games  i had originally imported this game back in october from japan even though i had no idea what was going on i could not put it down to this day i have over 100 hours played and i just picked up the american copy and i am currently playing it good pleasent and nicely done this game is truley a great game good job both arcade and console options this was excellent in that it was retro enough for someone like me ive been through 4 levels so far on hard  the game is much easier to play with a controller over a joycon or as a handheld i enjoy the game  it is very unforgiving to the player  and i like to jump  so i love to jump to my death good content just rushed through the game within a week and got a refund i like the career mode and customization just wish the career mode was longer i bought the game a week ago and have completed the campaign along with trying out the some of the other options this game is very good and keeps you on your toes throughout the whole campaign i wouldn’t suggest if you suffer from high levels of anxiety and paranoia aside from that it’s a great title that really knows how to keep things interesting we got this game a couple of weeks ago this game glitches so much there are times where the superstars are wrestling and then all of a sudden one guy is standing in the corner and the other guy is standing near by but nothing is happening they wont move for a bit if stressing you out was the objective good job controls fly around and youre dropped into a pit of monsters every time cant stop moving ever hardly a strategic advantage to anything guess its just not my game anymore i bought this on october 11th and enjoyed that this game had plenty of content it was such a refreshing step in the series it is a very good game and i like it in handheld mode just got the game the day it came out and i love it great graphics it delivers everything i thought it would i bought this last week for the nintendo switch and it’s two thumps up always a good game to play and 2k showcase mode is always great and glad they brought it back don’t think i would’ve bought the game if it wasn’t showcase mode this looks and plays amazing on a nintendo switch  extremely happy with my purchase bought this game on day one and so glad i did as it’s super fun and enjoyable for any wwe fan i hate bethesdas business and legal practices with a fiery passion but theres no getting around how honest this game is when i played doom as a kid this sort of action is exactly what my imagination conjured it plays extremely well on the switch graphics are also incredible and fps drops are basically nonexistent good work id and bethsoft feels like you are really in the wrestling match minus the pain excellent game offline bots single player and multiplayer fun and looks good this game was purchased for my uncle and he seems to enjoy playing it so far the game tends to glitch and lag the my career mode however is fun and more entertaining then last years i do feel as wwe has step their game up for the better my career mode is so good with the storytelling the only thing i would about it i believe the game should be a lot longer overall the game is one of a kind next year i believe they should included woman in the career mode that would as bring life into this game this game is pretty fun but as i look back at older games from madagascar the animals use to run faster and they would be able to sprint also the missions where a lot more fun than the ones on madagascar 3 and more interesting and also they had alot more minigames please dreamworks and activision or d3 publisher for the next madagascar game make better graphicsmake the animals run faster more cool minigames cooler places like new york and africa jungle and the missions make them more interesting this review was collected as part of a promotion i got these d batteries thinking they will work longer in our old game camera it eats batteries real fast so i marked it down when i put them in and it’s still going i have to agree they say they last longer and they really do this review was collected as part of a promotion works well and the charge lasts a decent amount of time d batteries are the necessary evil of batteries few things use them but those that do are important glad these have a long shelf life so i can store them and know they will last this review was collected as part of a promotion im very happy with these batteries we keep them around for our emergency lights in case of blackouts and they are always dependable lately with our influx of toys that require batteries in the house they have been going to toys but i always feel that these batteries keeps toys going longer than other competitor batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer max alkaline d batteries give a maximum amount of power for whatever you use them for i have a light i use for my crafting projects that uses two d batteries as i use it often i go through batteries i found the max batteries last quite a while longer this review was collected as part of a promotion i’ve always used energizer batteries they last so long the best part is that i use size d batteries for my tent light my two last year lasted all of my camping trips all summer long so it was perfect for 2 more to come right when camping season for me started this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer is a name that you can trust for excellent battery life and reasonable pricing on their products these energizer max batteries are a great value and much better than generic batteries for sure this review was collected as part of a promotion we use these batteries for flashlights and a portable radio  we live in florida and good batteries are a musthave with the daily summer storms and hurricanes these batteries are dependable reliable and really last when you need them the most  shelf life is 10 years so we stock up on these for emergencies  these are also handy to have on hand for kids toys and other devices this review was collected as part of a promotion when i need d batteries i always buy energizer max it is the longest lasting d batteries that i have ever bought they work great and last forever my only con is the fact that they come in a 2 pack puyo puyo and tetris sign me up coach bad at both but still fun this review was collected as part of a promotion love the energized max alkaline d batteries that last forever and give out plenty of power they make my outside light seem brighter and they have lastest for a much longer time than the other batteries ive used will be buying more of these this review was collected as part of a promotion i use the energizer max alkaline d batteries to power my mechanical toys and i need a battery that wont slow down the toys performance energizer is the leader in batteries and i am quite satisfied with their quality fun and a good fallout game could have a little better graphics great game graphics are fantastic and the gameplay is classic bethesda its the fallout engine and world you know so well but with a focus on building little fortified communes for people to live in which makes all that scavenging that is so addictive worth something anything you can store in inventory can be used to build something however if you have an internet connection you can access mods for free and just have toolboxs of unlimted materials waiting at each location its hard to resist that and if you do that  youll sorta negate the reason for collecting anything other than ammo weapons armor clothes and whatever you like to display in your home and camps the beauty of that was that for me it didnt ruin the game  being a god right off the bat with all my goodies was just awesome im here to explore and do whatever i want since the world ended the game is a blast and its funny and smart but the characters could have been more original like in fallout 2 or 3 even new vegas had great npcs and this one does too just not as many the graphics on the pro i use are just awesome the colors in the game are vibrant its defiantly the best fallout game in the 3d universe made so far worth it gun physics are better and the way eneimes react to gettin hit by each shot after a certain perk is got adds fantastic realism shooting living things never felt so satisfying it’s a good game i just cannot get into it too much like i used to fallout is always a fun game and this one does not disappoint at all fantastic game the story and gameplay feel so smooth and make sense really dumb that you think your essential otherwise purchase was fine loved it it very fun and you have options to use mods and the fact that you can have a dov is awesome always loved the fallout series \\ngood story line and good game play cool game but stopped playing cause there was a death claw in the first 5 minutes pretty good game a little on the short side very similar to until dawn as far as graphics and gameplay very fun if you like story driven movie like experiences i loved this game way better than until dawn a must have for anyone who loves decision making movie games the game is solid and amazing the nu metal music is super cheesy and the replay value is 0 there is no way they are going to finish all 8 in the series before the fans move on overall it is a good game it is just extremely short i feel that the storyline should be a bit more indepth the graphics and controls are a little clunky but loved the movie night feature which allows up to 5 people to play it was a total blast really cool game to play by yourself or with a friend kind of short though cool story i like the choose your own adventure aspect great story fun to play but the game skippedglitched multiple times at crucial moments causing us to get characters killed that if the game worked properly and smoothly we very well may have been able to save very frustrating with this specific type of game overall a fun experience though felt like a teen novel with only terrible endings i more than anyone wanted to love this game so much having played until dawn religiously until i platinumed and then again every halloween season to say i was excited for this was an understatement however all i received was genuinely bad acting bad story and bad story paths the op being o death again but metal is pretty cool though awesome full of gore would definitely recommend this game to everyone it doom you buy this to play a run and gun with chainsaws and bfg \\r\\nwhat that not what you want then don’t buy it i bought the game around two and a half weeks ago it worked well for a week and now just wont start up the case they gave me came without a cover picture and only an ugly game stop one so it was an eyesore in my shelf but its a good game couldnt finish it though because you know the campaign is great multiplayer is pretty dead by now but fun if you’re into first person shooters this is an excellent game to get this is without a doubt the best shooter i have ever played second only to the original doom where it all began quite literally id and bethesda came together to create not a game but an experience that could hold a legitimate claim to the doom throne and what they came out with was overqualified doom or new doom as i like to call it is everything anyone can has and ever will love about the first person shooter genre and so much more it does what doom always has it innovates and improves upon the genre as a whole taking the best of it all and leaving out the worst new doom is a remaster reboot and sequel all in one nifty stressinducing tense hairraising hellraising actionpacked journey through an unending wave of death while doom is not known for its storytelling except for the film eugh and doom 3 new doom has a story but it doesnt foist it upon you every few minutes and then gives you very little action like most other shooters it keeps the story to a minimum and cranks the nonstop action to an astounding 150 and thats just after the first few chapters it ups the ante as the game goes on getting more and more intense its unrelenting and thats doom at its finest as it always has been even the bosses dont relent and even though they are few they make it feel like youre going up against multiple bosses at once the weapons are gorgeous i got so turned on by the gauss can on and when i discovered the siege mode powerup i absolutely lost it it doesnt introduce many new weapons in fact the gauss is actually the only new weapon but it more than makes up for that by introducing weapon mods which make it feel like youre using brand new weapons their abilities do use up considerable amount but it makes up for that by dealing devestatingly massive damage to your enemies and yes the chainsaw and the bfg are still there and yes they are as powerful as ever the demons are so perfectly updated in their appearance while they are a departure from the looks of the old demons its hard to mistake them for anything else other than what each individual demon is for example the imp looks wildly different but you still know its an imp just by the way it acts there are only 2 new demons in the main story but there is nothing wrong with that because this is new doom you came from the 1993 masterpiece hoping to have a go at your old favorites as well as a few new contenders and the game doesnt disappoint in the least bit besides the game keeps you tense and on your toes so much it doesnt matter from the sounds of it eternal will have so many more new demons which will more than make up for the lack of new demons here new doom is every bit of the shooter it makes itself out to be and is more than deserving of being on the roster of the doom series if youre reading this wondering if you should get in the game or not id say you should absolutely get into it rip and tear until it is done my fiancé and i bought a nintendo switch and bought doom for it the graphic and gameplay are amazing and excellent revamp to the old styles doom 2016 is an excellent game and it plays pretty well on the nintendo switch it can feel a bit odd when playing the game in handheld mode but this goes away after the first few hours i recommend using the pro controller when playing however if you prefer graphics over gameplay you might not find this port of doom to be enjoyable im looking forward to purchasing doom eternal this games sequel on switch when it releases if you are getting this game solely for campaign then skip this comment entirely because that part works splendidly and the load times are mind blowingly fast what contains the issues is the multiplayer not only are the servers so bad it will sometimes take over 30 minutes to find a game but the frame rate is so poor that it looks like you and the other person are lagging when it comes to fighting i had high hopes for this not as high as it was for the console of course but it sadly and utterly let me down the switch did a good job of laying out the framework for nintendo to have some amazing titles and collaborations in the future but this system was just not strong enough to do a game like this in multiplayer quite yet so if you wanted this for multiplayer save yourself some time and money and wait on this just stick to playing it on consoles thought it would be absolute trash being that it was for a nintendo console and also that it was for the switch but it’s absolutlely fantastic it performs just as it would perform on any other console with the pc master race being the exception i actually quite enjoy playing doom on the switch more than i had enjoyed playing on my ps4xb1 1210 would recommend i like the new sounds and trophies are tougher to get i bought this game a week and thought it was just what i expected and than some it could improve its the same every year they need to bring back create a story mode worst wrestling game in a while my career is atrocious and pointless save your money pass on this years game i bought it to see if any better ther career mode took strides but even with the kickstart for you player you still not even higher than a 50 overall player if they are making you pay for kickstarter they could atleast be higher the upgrade tree is not fun and seems agravating than helpful would rather keep last years wwe 2k19 is the most awesome wwe video game ever for this year and i was so happy about wwe 2k19 brings back showcase mode in the new title the return of daniel bryan and i did completed all the objectives from bryan danielson vs john cena from wwe velocity 2003 and the bonus fantasy match in wrestlemania 34  daniel bryan vs bryan danielson also i do like mycareer with chapters and voice overs inlcudes my favorite wwe superstars and the gameplay is awesome and the graphics are really awesome the picture is absolutely phenomenal  this with my evga nvidia rtx 3080 ti ftw32 ultra makes for a riveting experience  but alas it has a quirk\\nthe annoying thing is the faint intermittent crack coming out of the left  right speaker alternatingly  i wouldnt care because i have a 51 sound system but it unmutes itself  and begins to crack again  thought it might be the firmware  driver so i updated the firmware and installed the driver and it still does it\\ni chatted and was told that it might be a warranty issue and i got the number for support  i havent contacted support yet but i will update when i get off the phone with them tomorrow this monitor is beast i will never switch it with any other monitor worth the money this is just an amazing monitor  it really has transformed how i work and game  productivity is high because i can have multiple websites open as well as have all my applications on screen at once  no more dual monitors  \\nand gaming  just awesome to have such a huge view  from fps to driving to rts it is amazing how much i can see  i highly recommend having a beefy gpu to run it at anything above 120hz and ultra settings like a rtx3090

batteries so often this review was collected as part of a promotion i received these energizer max alkaline d batteries for my honest review first off they are the same size as any other d battery  put them in a mag flashlight and they seem to work pretty well too soon to say how long they will last and if they will last longer than standard d batteries but i guess time will tell this review was collected as part of a promotion we recently used the batteries in one of our sons toys  so far they seem to be doing the job hopefully they will not die out as quickly as most d batteries do they have lasted about a week so far and hoping to get use for longer this review was collected as part of a promotion what else can i say besides energizer are the best battery brands available  energizer is the gold standard of batteries  we couldnt be happier with the longevity of these batteries energizer is the only brand we use this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries

review was collected as part of a promotion i am so glad i tried these batteries  the life of them has been great they truly are long lasting they made my flashlight so much brighter they are heavy duty and shiny everybody needs these batteries i will be buying more my husband thought it was so cool he wanted to keep it for himself rather than give it to our son miles morales has become venom rodriguez hes meanobscene and loves rice and beans we first found out about pokemon black and white over a year ago then it came out in japan in september and now its finally in amercia it was well worth the wait pokemon black is the greatest game in the pokemon franchise by a considerable margin what seperates it from the other pokemon games is that it is just different all the pokemon in the main story are brand new there are two new types of battles they are rotation battles and triple battles they are a fresh new take on a classic battle system this is one of those games that you just cant put down i played 20 hrs the first four days i had this game its just that good it is a very fresh take on a classic games series it has absolutely amazing graphics these are by far the best graphics ever seen in a pokemon game these graphics push the ds graphic capabilites to its limits this is a very beautiful game over and over again i stopped playing to stare at the graphics you cant understand how good the graphics are until youve played the game the game has awesome music ive played a lot of games and i cant think of a game with as good music as this game the music is one of the many reasons that this is the best pokemon game yet this is a long game as it will take you about 24 hrs to beat it and then their is the aftergame this is the longest pokemon aftergame yet theres even a brand new champion to face there are a lot of legendary pokemon to catch this is will last a very long time the aftergame is just massive the game has the best story of any game i have played in a long time there is a lot of character development and moral questions the game takes pokekmon to new levels you ask yourself is team plasma the villians really evil there motives seem pure and good the game has outstanding pokemon and many new ways to play this is my new favorite game of all time i would reccomend it to anyone who considers themself a gamer this game is a system buyer i would buy a ds just for this game this game is an absolute masterpiece and should not be missed by anyone great detail on the toy  quick delivery at a great price pokemon black is a game of awsomethe game is for any pokemon fan around the globewith the over 150 new pokemon and multible differnt things to do and people to meetwhat can top thatvist my youtube page for pokemon black giveaways and more please suscribe to enter contestsits pokemoncollecterthats my youtube page i got white for the legendary guy and i gotta say this is a whole new experience in the world of pokemon they upped the difficulty so that you cant simply breeze through the game with a single strong guy which surprised me but hey who doesnt enjoy a bit of a challenge the experiments with 3d are very interesting and fun but unnecessary this is certainly just the start of something big i feel as though these little 3d areas will become the centerpiece of future games and i love that the characters frolick and close their eyes seriously genius innovations my complaints are the constant involvement of rivals and the 5th generation of pokemon they really shouldve stopped a couple years ago but we keep coming back p while certainly not the best of the pokemon games hiho soulsilver black and white provide an entertaining and unique experience that should be enjoyed by both new players and diehard classics alike pokemon games are usually cool but this game hit the next lvl i read that 70 people worked on the game and the people came through i turned out happy when i bought the game i havent stopped playing the game i actually played the game for 12 hours straight when it came out everyone of all time could love this game the new pokemon are amazing who couldnt love it there are so many cute onesi havent got to the end yet but i cant wait to catch the legendary pokemon reshiram cause that one is powerful except it only knows one move team plasma shows up a lot but they are easy i hope my review was some what hellpful so please try the game   bye when i first heard they were producing another pokemon game i will admit i was more than a bit unsure at first glance of the new pokemon i actually laughed and said this was going to be the worst game and they should really give up on pokemon if this is what theyve got i was wrong while some of the pokemon are still unsatisfying compared to past pokemon i have truly fallen in love with this game the graphics are impeccable and castelia city is the most incredible work of art and amazing graphics ive ever seen on a nintendo ds the only complaint i have is that the menu should be on the touch screen like it was in heart gold and soul silver instead of the c gear but i love the c gear as well so its hard to decide how i really feel about the set up although like i said im sill iffy on the pokemon but i understand how they came to be so since the game is largely focused on industry the pokemon reflect that trubbish and garbodor are the only two i still really dont like but again best pokemon game to date im truly in love amazeing game with great graphics i love it so much it deffinetly great if your new to pokemon like i always say in with the new out with the old and so on platinum was great soul silver was amazeing and i deffinetly cant wait to get this game its been anticipated for a year now and i will be getting it some time in the next few weeks so yeah d must have for pokemon gamers pokemon gamers unite i got this game when it first came out and ive been playing it everyday since but i dont like how when you battle or anything that is closer to the screen is blurry which i know means it would be 3d on the 3ds but still i wish i could have bought a nintendo ds lite version its oki preferer white bc you can get zekarom i received pokemon black on march 6th 2011 since then ive been playing for quite some time the pokemon are certainly different from other versions of pokemon such as diamond ruby silver etc generation x and v pokemon show how far the pokemon company has come since generation i yellow red blue the graphics show how advanced the pokemon company has become the 3d really shows and if the pokemon company is planning on making a version for the upcoming 3ds i would certainly think that it would truly be a breathtaking game as a player i certainly love this game i do believe that team plasmas goal is quite different from those of the past and there are many mysteries awaiting to be uncovered if you are a dedicated player who plans on sticking through pokemon black andor white until the end i strongly suggest purchasing this game however if you feel that you will play it for a few days then quit i would not recommend getting it because pokemon black  white are the kind of games you just have to stay until the end to fully understand everything its worth getting and is one of my best purchases this is the best handheld game ever pokemon always has been the best but black and white take it to the next and what i think is the final level i love all the details for example eyes closing when pokemon is asleep characters can move their arms the gyms are awesome with anything from roller coasters to cannons to countless elevators not to mention all the new pokemon a must have for pokefans and nintendo worshippers features everything youd want in a choose your own adventure game with the possibility of replay makes this a very well done game by far one of the best games out right now this needs a higher rating impressed with the graphics storyline and development of the entire game kept me guessing all the way through it was an amazing experience had a lot of fun playing with my girlfriend the amount of choices and various different outcomes we can have while playing always keeps the gameplay fun and exciting we manage to discover something drastically new every time we re play the story much less polish than until dawn a few glitches awkward transitions and overall jagged edges were distracting it was a good game but the controls were kinda not all there  and the game was too short  until dawn is an older game but a master piece i give it a 10 wish the story line was longer bit over all an enjoyable game as you can probably tell by the review title i’m still working on beating the game at the moment while the characters in this aren’t as likable in until dawn this one is a lot harsher on qte’s quick time events than until dawn that said it’s somewhat more intense than until dawn but not quite as intense as the vr prequel to until dawn “the inpatient” but it’s still just as unsettling as the both games while i may have yet to have beaten the vr game and man of medan all three games are great scary games in their own way amazing and worth its price to the penny just left me wanting korw than i hoped for it is actually kind of nice to play a game i don’t have to spend months completing it’s beautiful and well done and it is short enough to entice a redo if your outcome isn’t what you hoped the graphics are awesome the gameplay is smooth the jumpscares r abundant and catch u off guard at first i didn’t like this game it came off as a bit tedious with helping all these different groups you joined eventually i just stopped dealing with those side missions and stuck with the main story and had a much better experience who you’re in league with does effect the difficulty of the game toward the end and at that point i was in the good graces of only one of the three groups the wrong one at that it all works out fine if you can use your power suit to overcome the extra level of difficulty pay attention to what the different groups say about each other and you might change your opinion about whos side you’re on it was a very unexpected outcome i experienced but still a good one played the old fallout titles and this one stepped it up a notch graphics are great gameplay is great the crafting system is awesome there is a ton to explore it keeps my husband busy and i love watching him play it first time getting into the franchise i like it so far this game was not what i expected and the reviews were misleading i love the fallout series such an immersive game i thought too many people gave this game a bad rep it was a fun action adventure shooter it wasnt your typical rpg but it was still extremely fun and had a lot of  replayability if you think of it as its own game as you should then maybe you wont be so disappointed that its not exactly like fallout 3 it’s like any fallout game easy to navigate but can get boring the more you play it over and over good story very bloody too much cussing for my taste but overall very satisfying to play i really love it especially the combat and weapon crafting as well this is the first game i bought for the switch  wow doom portable the levels take a long time to load but i am enjoying the game itself this is a good port of doom it does have an 8 gig install and it does have some long loading times but besides those things it is a great game this is the best doom so far looking forward to doom eternal for the switch coming from a pc that runs doom at 1440p 144fpsi was surprised how well doom runs on the switch must have for the switch a10 it’s so much fun and replay is great shoot ‘me up demon fun doom is challenging yet fun to play i love that its not to dark east to see demons before they kill you great port of the new doom though the game isnt quite as crisp as the ps4 and xbox one versions its still looks and runs great on the switch my only gripe and this isnt gamestops fault but the price is still a little high nintendo needs to address this yes yes yes im a happy man the new doom ultimate is coming on the switch as well im not a big fan of first person shooters but i remembered the nostalgia of doom so i decided to try it out amazing feels like doomevery encounter can be your last if youre not careful run smooth and has collectables to offer good replay value i purchased this for my travels on the road i love it it plays great it’s a lot like the original this review was collected as part of a

power up just fine i like that they have alkaline in them so it gives out a lot of power and does not use much energy yet are strong i use my remote control all the time and have  not had any issue my remote is still running strong i recommend these batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion i recently bought my son a new toy for his birthday that requires this size of battery and i was trying to use cheaper brands i kept having to replace them frequently so i got these and it fixed my problem super long lasting highly recommend this review was collected as part of a promotion i am using these batteries in a motion light for outside and the area has a lot of traffic which makes the light turn on a lot though out the night i have had these batteries in the light for about a week now and i am shocked that i have not had to replace them as of yet the light has not dimmed out or anything i will be getting more of these batteries for the flashlights in the house this review

what you pay for energizer batteries seem to last forever i honestly don’t even look at other brands anymore i always go to energizer first this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer max alkaline d batteries have a 10year shelf life there are two d batteries in one pack for convenience energizer are my goto batteries for their consistent performance these batteries are a must for every household highly recommended this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries are great i have been using them for years and have not had to change very often they hold a good charge for a very long time for instance they have been in the same light for about 2 years have not changed them out since these are a life savor this review was collected as part of a promotion i bought energizers max alkaline d batteries about a month ago and i’m so glad i did they are working phenomenally i have to constantly change my d batteries in this one speaker i use all the time i go through so many batteries i have now had them for over a month and they are going strong they might be the best batteries i have ever used if you have to buy batteries these are the way to go they definitely won’t disappoint this review was collected as part of a promotion i had just replaced the batteries in my flashlight with an off brand and wasn’t thrilled with the light i was getting so i replaced the batteries with these energizers what a difference much more light output from these batteries i will be sticking with these for my flashlight from now on i always love pokemon and everything about them the only thing i dont like is the updated look of the people i kinda liked the old boxy versions like in diamond and platinum and heartgold just saying but awesome game nonetheless a great game for any pokemon fan or anyone who likes video games the graphics and sound of pokemon black are awsome\\nsome of the pokemon are good but some look stupid pokemon black is the best pokemon game made so far i like how the graphics are new and everything seems better than the last games before this one i also like how there are new pokemon i have not yet seen before i liked how they mixed things up a bit because usually the first gym is always a rock type gym but they changed it to a battle between the type you picked grass fire or water and what its weak against i would recommened this game to any pokemon fans out there and even people who may not like pokemon that much after my first day on this game i was hooked my starter was oshowatt and already has reached its final evolutionary stage i got five badges already and already caught victini if i had a piece of advice battle everyone strength is major in this epic new pokemon game also some trainers give you free items for you beating them but type matchups can be a struggle so hear is something very useful at the first gym the leader will tell you you should have a pokemon that is good againt bad matchups so he tells you to go train at a sertain place go there and find this one guy who gives you a free pokemon for an advantage at the gym if you chose snivy a water type oshowatt with a fire type and tepig gets you a grass type this is probably nintendos best game ever the only games that could come close are older pokemons and super smash bros but id definetly give this an 82 out 10 i have been playing pokemon since bluered came out and this game is by far the best pokemon game every created i love everything about it and the storyline is truly fantastic to go through the changes they made to graphics and environment are revolutionary for pokemon and it truly creates a new dynamic the game is very fun and it is more challenging then the others and they created some pretty awesome new pokemon the way they changed tms and the new phone system alone are superb the way you can connect to friends also makes the game very fun if you are a pokemon fan then blackwhite is a must have i promise you will not be disappointed with this game i cant belive its outt i mean they kinda ruined it with r4 so it beats it with dpplhgss its awesome i mean they its a great game i bought this game yesterday and it is aswome new pokemon i never seen before great starters love it i would recomend this game to all pokemon fans i just got the game yesterday and i love it well it came out yesterday so i guess a lot of people got it i chose snivy and i have to say it is a really great game i cant stop playing in the middle of the night pokemon black along with its counterpart pokemon white are two great pokemon games it still retains the basic pokemon formula beat all 8 gyms and become the champion however i have two specific complaints about the game first the fifthgen pokemon they seemed rushed and unoriginal spoiler warning second once you beat the elite four you would expect to fight the champion right wrong the evil teams leader n comes and makes you fight him right after catching reshiram then you fight the other leader i was looking forward to fighting adeku not the two leaders other people may like this change but i dont the graphics are the best i have ever seen in any pokemon game so far over all this is a very good pokemon game but not the best i guess its ok  its all story not really a video game  more like a choose your own adventure  they should classify it as its own genre ive already played through twice i love this game this is a good game although not as good as until dawn  be honest i am not sure why it is less fun compared to until dawn probably because until dawn has bunch of goofy teenagers so far this game is good i loved until dawn and it is exactly that your choices make the game or story progress certain outcomes high playability good game with lots of jump scares  replaying to change the endings was fun too very good story and lure i just wish it was longer great game  creepy  fun to play and cheaper than most games great game from supermassive games if you liked until dawn and hidden agenda full of jump scares and eerie feelings and situations game was very interesting a lot of jump out your skin moments i loved it awesome very creepy and loved every minute of it this game is awesome i play this for hours a day although there was a glitch one time and small lag sometimes there is also sometimes where the world would be loading textures so i would see colorful dirt or the graphics would be bad until it loaded in a few seconds overall awesome game great game its a little bit slow at the begining but its entertaining such a good game really cheap price in store too its fallout 4  amazing game that sucks you in and keeps you invested fallout is my favorite series fallout 4 is not as good as new vegas or 3 but it’s still very good this is the very first time i played fallout an im in love good game overall decent graphics and good gameplay glitches here and there would recommend for people who are into a lot of exploration and shooting games last good bethesda gamegood for multiple playthroughs very fun and addictive game great graphics and storyline one of the best games ever endless play value if you like the building aspects bought the switch for my wife and got this game for myself now she never gets to play her games lol the gameplay itself is clearly good the problem is the blur is so unbearable i tried it again after the patch to improve performance i cant recommend this game as it can make you sick doom is a great game 910 for me but  what makes this version so good is the switch i have never played a better looking or better running shooter on a portable system it’s nothing short of amazing i am very satisfied by the gameplay of this having it on the go really makes it a great purchase for the nintendo switch theres only a select few points where the the lags also it takes boring nuances of shooters and disposes of them no reloading animation no place to hide for cover you let it all out and have to glory kill to get health as mark brown points out in his video about doom the game revolves around the glory kill mechanic and it makes for huge fights where you have to dance around the area just great i love this gamestraight to the pointshoot and destroy everything anarchy great game fast paced shooter with a really interesting story line if you choose to dive in to the data logs just challenging enough with in depth multiplayer to keep you interested i was so excited to relive my childhood by destroying demons but the worst developers in the business got their hands on the project heres how they ruined it\\r\\nleveling up im trying to kill demons not dragons foh with that skyrim rpg garbage\\r\\nmandatory internet connection i bought this for my portable system why would i need to be connected to the internet to play campaign youve literally made it unplayable for the majority of the customers oh and if your connection drops it boots you and loses progress\\r\\nmassive download if you dont have an sd card and have some other games on the system youre gonna have to choose between them \\r\\nno screenshots not a deal breaker but a pretty stupid restriction \\r\\n\\r\\nim hoping for an update thatll allow me to play offline till then its a dockedonly game the multiplayer rocks the campaign rocks you can play it anywhere rocks it just makes sense for more third party companies to port their games to switch 20 million consoles sold already you can expect to make at least 5 million copies sold this game is amazingits like a more gory metroid game plus having it on the go is amazing for not having played doom remake before elsewhere this game was absolutely amazing great accomplishment on devs part to have this run smoothly on the switch encountered few frame stutters when there was a lot of demons and combat going on nothing to impactful however graphics are decent lots of blurring to hide probably heavily compressed textures knocked down a star for bland multiplayer hard to even find a match unless you play with friends unless you highly value the portability i’d suggest you purchase the game for somthing other than the switch i got the 28 odyssey g70a 4k uhd and the odyssey g7 curved 32 cg75 wqhd to run as multiple displays in my office i am using them for multitasking office

keyboard  im so glad to get stronger longer lasting batteries but time will tell how long they will last  they perform well with a good strong sound on the keyboard so far yes its another pokemon game i get it people still buy them so they are still selling them its the same thing the last 20 some games have been i enjoyed pokemon for a while i did but they arent even trying anymore have you seen the new pokemon designs its like they got them from deviantart actually that might have been an improvement i gave it a good music review due to the fact those little tunes are catchy ill give it that but honestly they arent even trying anymore i suppose you would love this game if youre a die hard pokemon fan and i suppose kids would as well as the series will still be new to them but anyone who enjoyed the old games should know by now what to expect a hundred hours of walking in grass to get the badges and beat your rival picture is a random pokemon from the game tell me thats not just a tauros with an afro you know tauros the pokemon from the first games ive seen videos and stuff and the graphics look awesome cant wait until the english version comes out you cant even read the japenese words hope it is worth the wait i dont know what the previous person who commented on here was playing but if you know anything about pokemon the games get better and better as they evolve and make the games near perfect i myself have not yet played the japanese versions of bw but when the us release happens i will be getting both games and playing to my hearts content i still play my copies of hg  ss over and over and cant get enough of them so ignore those people who are ignorant of pokemons success and as they say gotta catchem all i cant wait this will be great just like every other one this pkmn looks awesome cant wait to play it hopefully its more enhanced since ss and hg d i cant wait until 2011 for this game i have herd that when you preorder you gat a pokemonk keychain that plays the main legondaries cry i especialy like the profile scenes the squrile legondary looks awsome it is a very awesome11 look i bought this game in japanese and it just was ok i played it alot because i wanted to playthrough the game just for fun the graphics were great and there wasnt alot of challenge to the game i mean come on i caught the legendary on the box in a pokeball on my first try this game was not hard but fun altogether i liked the basics that it had in all of the other games but its just all the same i will do a speed run of the game when it comes out so i might put that up on my youtube page but i just dont think its any different than any other pokemon game cant wait for the english version looking up all the informtion i can pokemon black have so much 3d action in it when u get the 3ds u can see full 3d action serviceable characters with a short and predictable narrative but still a fun horror game to play with friends not as scary as until dawn and i felt like the opening of the game took forever the story was super predictable none of my characters died really solid game choices matter and the story is good but it can be a tad slow at times this game was alright but honestly it reminded me to much of until dawn which isnt surprising since its made by the same writers a very strong play through and pretty scary be careful of what you choose cause people will die good luck a good spooky experience if you’re looking for some good jump scares and mystery character controls can be clunky but is manageable however lag can be a serious issue like causes characters to die especially if you’re playing online with someone lots of possible endings compared to until dawn so you tend to want to go back for more it was ok cheesy jump scares was the majority of the game the ending was lame and once you find out what is going on it almost ruins the story only get it if you love until dawn and that format of game great story line fun to play alone or with friends great game although too short but alternative endings help make up for this great game i love the graphics it has a nice historical theme i always enjoy a game that gives you options that can make a difference in the outcome the characters have very distinctive personalities there is also a cool feature that allows you to play the game with up to five people each player plays one character and each character has their own episode i just did not like that the game was so short and it is obvious what is happening from the beginning there was not much mystery great fps game for all switch owners panic button did an excellent job on porting this game to the nintendo switch as a nintendo fan its great seeing a highend game like this on the switch as it proves what the system could do if youre a switch owner looking for an actionpacked shooter look no further great game very fast passed and loved the guns and demons and everything runs very smooth on the switch nothing like putting down zombies in handheld mode my wife got me this game for fathers day and it is wickedly awesome and fun i havent played any doom games since doom ii on the playstation and was just looking for a good and difficult fps to play this is all that and more theres a great online multiplayer mode thats really fun to play im very glad i bought this it fills the same multiplayer fps good that a game like call of duty might the gameplay and storyline flowed great only complaint i had was not being able to adjust the targeting speed exactly right for my response still fun other than a few minor bugs and technical issues the game plays phenomenally the sound track is pretty killer too wasnt sure how much i would enjoy the game ended up having a lot of fun playing doom is a very good game that i think everybody that loves first person shooters should play there are just a couple of things that i would change to make the gameplay better there should tell you were to go because i got lost a long time in certain parts and they should make your last a little bit long instead of dying so fast other then that it is a good game this game is a total grind not enough content for me i was told it’s skyrim in a modern day city it’s nothing like skyrim at all do yourself a favor and skip this title i bought doom a couple weeks ago  so far i love this game  the graphics look great on switch  obviously not ps4 quality but definitely better than ps3 quality  the frame rate is really stable so far and the game is just plain fun  love it i haven’t played it yet but my oldest really likes it i love the game because there is so much to do besides killinggreat way to shutoff the real world another great game by bethesda to get lost in vast postatomic bomb world with fantastic 50sinspired theme i love the ambient 50s beebop music playing on the occasional radio you come across in some abandoned building the cute scifiinspired name of food and household products the old metal lawn furniture and funky old rusted out cars lying all over the wasteland youre equipped with a wearable computer that displays in old analog monochromatic interface like old terminals and vault boy is your friendly avatar that is animated to show you how things work its fantasic i enjoy a game that lets me make my own decisions i get lost for hours just looking for treasure lol maybe i’m bias but this game is absolutely wonderful it’s like skyrim but with guns and upgrades highly recommend great game amazing graphics build mode is new and rough but still good i had previously seen small clips of fallout four gameplay and decided i would give it a try i mean its fallout 4 its easily as great as skyrim got it for a friend he hasnt gotten the chance to play yet but is excited to play it this review was collected as part of a promotion my son and i are both avid gamers purchasing our monitor was a great decision theres no more glare issue he does another of 1st person gaming and its like her actually there he says wrapped up all in the games he says the sound quality is amazing graphics are above and beyond expectations coloring is on point what more can

promotion this monitor is great for gaming really like to curve helps keep everything in visual site this review was collected as part of a promotion its great monitor with higher resolution and fast processor this review was collected as part of a promotion i use it for video streaming and video games movies its also a cool tv this review was collected as part of a promotion ive always found energizer to be one of the most trustworthy battery brands not only do they have a long shelf life but they seem to last a long time in my electronics i immediately popped it in my large flashlight and it worked perfectly the 10 year battery life is incredible the only change i would make would be to add an expiration date or a more obvious one on the packaging overall i  like and trust these batteries they work well and are great to keep for an emergency id recommend them this review was collected as part of a promotion i’ve done a lot of research on batteries and have even done a few experiments testing different brands  from what i’ve read and seen first hand energizer batteries are by far the best batteries out there  \\r\\n\\r\\nfirst they have a very long shelf life  this is extremely important to me since i live in an area prone to storms and power outages  i know i can always count on my little “stockpile” of energizer batteries whenever i need them\\r\\n\\r\\nsecond these are alkaline batteries  this is the most common type you’ll see in the stores but it’s worth point out  there are also a lot of so called extra heavy duty batteries which actually use zinc not alkaline  this type of battery will last less than half as long and are prone to leaking  \\r\\n\\r\\nthird energizer batteries will outlast any other battery  this isn’t an exaggeration and you can do a simple test to see for yourself  one way would be to use identical flashlights with two energizer d batteries in one and different brands in the others  flip them on at the same time and i can guarantee that the energizers will be the last to run out\\r\\n\\r\\nif you’re looking for a dependable battery care about your electronics and want something that will last then energizers are the batteries for you this review was collected as part of a promotion these are reliable batteries if you want a brand name battery these are the ones for you of course there are cheaper ones out there but these are well worth the money and last a long time they also have a long shelf life so you are always prepared this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries are huge and the only thing that i really use them for now for my heavyduty flashlight these batteries are really great and they have a great  battery life it is also very powerful and has yet to run out of charge this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer is my go to brand for battery needs they last a long time and give max performance we go through alot of ds in particular for all the baby toys so these are great to have its a brand i can rely on these are currently in a baby swing and going strong this review was collected as part of a promotion quite some time ago i purchased frameless candles and solely used duracell batteries  i was in a situation where i needed batteries and energizer was all i could find  not only did i notice a difference in the length of battery life i immediately noticed that the candles appeared brighter  i wouldn’t use anything but energizer and use them all throughout my home this review was collected as part of a promotion these are the perfect batteries for my flashlight one of the best things about these is that they last a long time which is perfect for those random thunderstorms it makes my flashlight shine very bright i will continue to get these in the future this review was collected as part of a promotion the best battery when it comes to baby rockers no contest they devour batteries up and so far the only ones strong enough to fight for my peace and quiet are energizer max i miss the energizer bunny but he was right they go on and on and on this review was collected as part of a promotion these energizer max alkaline batteries last a super long time we are using them in one of our kids toys that never gets turned off and they just keep going and they work as good as they did on day one no problem with corrosion at all either this review was collected as part of a promotion im using the energizer batteries in my maglite flash light\\r\\nwe always keep extra batteries around\\r\\nall we tend to purchase energizer batteries \\r\\ni feel that theyre made very well and last a long time we all agreed that the sloth was his spirit animal favorite tee got a compliment at the grocery store truly a magnificent shirt pokemon black is a awesome game so much new pokemon now for pokemon fans its harder to catch em all it sucks that pokemon do not follow you tt it is so much fun i player the japinese version its not very good but is is still an awesome game i bet the english version will be soooo much better pokemon white is good too but not much more pokemon i plan to have these as my pokemon enbouhdragonitenagekisevipermetagross and zeburaika ps i am a boy that is 13 years old it nice to see game freak mixing up there games a little instead of just simply slappin down the same content with more pokemon they try to push themselves they are making pokemon move in battle and you can see most of your character obviously there are people who are not big fans of change but to be honest i feel this is a step in the right direction on there part also most might complain about the gameplay do to the fact of the short story and not much depth but to be truthful i never played it for that reason i play to catch em all  this game is the best and i love it overall this game has the best pokemon ever it is a big hit i love the series and all but once you get the national pokedex the whole game just falls apart this game is going to be amazing i played the japan game version and it is amzing i heard this game is coming out in america in eather march or april cant wait wish i had gotten this from japan the one thing i hate about is the short storyline everything else is good though i have played the jp version of pokemon black and white  and i have to say that these games are just the type of kick to the series to really bring pokemon back to light\\n\\nin a move that hasnt happened since the time of rby pokemon blackwhite introduces not only new pokemon but 155 new pokemon none of them are a preevolution or an evolved form of previous pokemon new neverbefore used pokemon types are used brand new abilities and the team of this generation has a unique motive\\n\\nalso in the new region of isshu unova in the english version apparently none of the first 493 pokemon appears in regular gameplay before beating the game this might sound bad at first but wait until you see how the developers make them available for capture at least in the jp version anyway\\n\\nthe aesthetic changes are very refreshing the 3d graphics in this game are amazing for a ds game the biggest examples of these graphics arenoi already said too many spoilers  however my only qualm with this game is the fire starter youll see why when you evolve him also there arent very good hm hoarders this time around but these factors dont actually affect the game that much if at all\\n\\nunless a certain game is released next year pokemon bw could very well be the best game of 2011 and of the first quarter of 2012 anyone who considers him even a little bit of a gamer must play this game at least once\\n\\ni end my review with the battle system with the addition of rotation battles and triple battles more animated battle sprites and with combo attacks in addition to everything else playing pokemon bw made me feel like i was 4 again playing pokemon blue for the first time this game is going to be super awesome cant wait for a whole new adventure after playing the previous games for the ds the fighting mechanincs are way better and from what i hear gamefreak outdid themselves this game rocks and theres rumor its coming out march 20th who knowsbut lets hope so  its going to be 3d i love that also the new move combos are excenlent at first i did not know what this was going to be this is until i went to serebii and got to know all about it triple battles ggear new pokemon both pokemon and areas excluseive to the to games but looking at the exculisve pokemon and all that i think black is better but i think either is going to be amazing a lot of bugs that freeze game play at the moments you’re supposed to button mash so your character dies even when you’re quick to press the correct prompts this review was collected as part of a promotion i used more time for work but i saw many movies even i redirect my job to my home and like part of my job doing in my i own computer and my monitor like i can use im my both places is very conveniencecandvery chespe considering the price versus service like reasons to get some pizza in our movies time  since my monitor is really good size color and wide screen if you enjoyed until dawn youll probably like this  too player control is a bit clunky and not being able to pan the camera angle is kinda frustrating  but i really dug the dynamics of trait and relationships as you make decisions  as well as the bearings how decisions you make affect future story options and play  \\nit was kinda short but i guess thats to be expected  so the developpers can bang out several in the series hopefully quickly  and the price reflects that 30 compared with the usual 60 i managed to keep all 5 characters alive which was much harder to do in until dawn  so im not sure if thats simply because this one is less lethal overall  or if i just got lucky this review was collected as part of a promotion great for gaming and sound perfect i love samsung products seems cool so far great fun with family good jump scares graphics are mediocre story line is a bit too long and drawn out so far this review was collected as part of a promotion i use it for gaming and school and its great the colors are sharp and everything its perfect definitely a scary game with lots of jump scares love that my choices are like a butterfly effect for the whole game this review was collected as part of a promotion i use my  crg9 dual qhd curved qled\\xa0 for \\nstreaming and just playing games it is very big and useful when i need to see small details \\none of the features i love is that how big it is the game is very interesting and paced pretty well the animations and jumps between gameplay and cutscene are a little rough but its a good game excited for the rest of the anthology this review was collected as part of a promotion the 32 inch model we tested has great contrast so blacks look black in a dark room and we expect the 27 inch model to perform similarly overall its one of the best gaming monitors on the market with an outstanding response time incredibly low input lag and great additional gaming featuressep 1 2021o gaming monitors will have features such as response times that are much faster than regular monitorsusually between 1ms and 5ms for gaming monitors and also higher refresh ratessometimes as high as 144 hz like the asus pg278q  thats part of why gaming monitors are important for gamers i find the game keeps accordance with how until dawn had played but with a few modern twists to improve upon the gameplay\\r\\n\\r\\nthere was a couple issues with the game sticking at certain points but other than that i saw no major drawbacks to the game this review was collected as part of a promotion thank you very much for everything have a great day story line is ok had fun playing it wish it was more like until dawn  this review was collected as part of a promotion i use it for gaming i love the clarity and sound and sleek design feels like a resident evil game without the shooting this review was collected as part of a promotion i love it and the monitor is really good with led so i suggest yall to get it slowish controls popping in textures was annoying qte galore story seemed interesting to peruse but lost interest in before technically id say chapter 2 which its considered chapter 4 iirc  watched a youtuber and the story still seemed interesting but really gas was making them go insane like did no one check the stuff at all during the transport whatever maybe nextone will be more mystical like their original until dawn this review was collected as part of a promotion i watch alot of movies \\nwe enjoy the curve my family loves the graphics awesome game with good jump scares and different endings this review was collected as part of a promotion i use this monitor for gaming and i love it it was a money spent well best game is fallout 4 the new fallout  sucks we are tired of being ask at gamestop to join the membership boo on you gamestop classic so much content and so little time to do it i dont know about this game i bought it for my girlfriend but she seems to love it a whole bunch i have played the fallout series in order and this is as far as ive gotten this is the best fallout yet  i love it it is very addictive shaun easy to play lots of fun alot of things to do and really fun action game aye man this story is so indepth if you hack terminals and actually read the story like how the vault program was really a testing spot for temporary cryogenic freezing and it was meant to be a secret and that everyone was dispensable and theres so much more it’s a game you don’t want to put down i was skeptical because i don’t usually go for survival games but this one has enough plot that keeps me invested for 100 hours dang there is so much to do to explore to build even if you finish the challenges you can still keep building exploring and so much more this is definitely not a weekend game it’s more like a month after month sit back and enjoy the challenge wonderful game each time you play its a new experience doom  awesome just like the old one re done revamped and perfect for the switch  this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer max alkaline batteries are the best battery to have on hand for any occasion  the max holds up to hours and hours and usage and keep battery operated toys and anything else you might need powered up and ready to use i would definitely recommend energizer max to anyone wanting a powerfullong lasting battery i bought doom about a month ago and have been loving the multiplayer fast pace arena style gameplay actually having  to find armor and health is a challenge forcing you to use different tactics when engaging enemy players one well armored player can easily overcome the odd of fight two opposing players if they didnt take the time to grab armor another fun challenge is to fight for survival just to grab one of the power weapons when eryone knows the location and when it is going to spawn this review was collected as part of a promotion good long lasting power batteries perfect for those toys that drain batteries very quickly really great that they hold power for up to 10 years while in storage will not have to worry about batteries for awhile especially when urgent situations come up i played before on the pc but the aiming feature on the switch gives it a plus its amazing i just love it this review was collected as part of a promotion excellent quality batteries  other brands i have had trouble leaking losing power but these energizers have been great  the brand is keeping their quality up  these also store a bit longer than others i have noticed by the expiration date great game glad it came to the switch w excellent content  graphics so glad i purchased this for my son this review was collected as part of a promotion if youre like me youve always thought batteries are batteries and paid no mind to brandwrongand ive found out the hard way ive had batteries that didnt fit securely because of a smaller than standard size some that didnt last more than a few days in a low drain device and some that leaked into the device after just a few months well let me tell yathese energizer max d batteries are exactly what i prefer in my name brand flickering flameless candles they fit snugly and dont bend the spring and by far outlast competitors as a person who frequented fps games like halo and cod on the xbox this seemed like a logical early purchase for my switch overall its an excellent game the campaign has good replay ability and is actually quite challenging making it a rewarding experience to play through it the graphics are excellent for a handheld device really accentuating the carnage associated with the game havent done much multiplayer yet but from what i have experienced so far the matchmaking works pretty well and is extremely competitive cant beat taking online multiplayer onthego this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer is always a trusted brand the batteries are long lasting you don’t feel like you constantly have to change them because they run low i use them in a string of lights in my sons room that works as a night light they last a really long time dont let the specs turn you away from this game its still fun as heck even undocked its a blast this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer max alkaline d batteries has the best batteries and very easy to use i hope everyone gets to try it out very soon and buy their productsi will be buying more very soon thanks for letting me try this out i will be buying more soon amazing port very well done i have this game on pc and it feels better to be honest most likely because i can take it to work i can number 2 and play i also played today while waiting on my significant other to grocery shop ahhhhhhh this review was collected as part of a promotion i got these energizer max alkaline d batteries 2 pack for my large lantern they fit perfectly the battery allows my lantern to shine brightly these batteries are long lasting i keep this lantern and batteries in my hurricane kit for emergencies i know with these batteries i’ll definitely be ready for a loss of power tons of fun great fun i was a little nervous after reading about some of the technical compromises that had to be made to bring this to the switch but after playing it for countless hours i am very impressed graphics are nice game plays smooth i have had one sound drop but it wasn’t bad  kinda like someone turned my tv down a little but the problem fixed it self great add to the switch this review was collected as part of a promotion i am very pleased with the energizer max batteries as they are the longest lasting batteries i have used i use these d batteries in all of our flashlights that i keep throughout our house and it gives me peace of mind knowing that they will work whenever we need them the batteries do not leak after being stored in any device over a long period time and have a 10 year shelf life in my opinion energizer max is the most dependable battery one of the best fps is finally on a nintendo console this review was collected as part of a promotion got these batteries put them in a lantern to take fishing use lantern on the dock and lantern lasted  and put out great light batteries are still charged and working great lasting longer than other brands will definitely be getting more of these im a huge fan of shooters and online shooters this is hands down the best online multiplayer youll ever have on a hand held this is my first time playing the game but fully enjoying the experience they took time with this port and its a amazing port from its original the story line is straight forward not the most amazing thing youll ever see or play through but the multiple things and features including online multiplayer will entertain you for man man hours in total great purchase buy it this review was collected as part of a promotion the battery lasts a very long time it is very durable i put it in my toddler’s toys and it is working great after a few months it is still working i would definitely recommend this brand of batteries this game is going to be great i have played this but its japanese hahaha everything is awesome when the pokemon gets hit by sleep powder it starts closing its eyes and it moves while it is in battle there is only 1 thing i dont like is its no more pokemon following you tt i loved it when pokemon followed you last but not least my favorite part is if you have a dsi you can see your friends or something i heard  the to new legends are zekrom and reshiam coming out in april when i first heard about black and white i was a bit skeptical because there are so many pokemon and pokemon games so i thought what else coud they have i had decided not to get it at first cuz it probably woudnt be good but then i learned a little more about it like the triple battles the way the cities are designed and i saw all the new pokemon it was going to have and it completely changed my mind so overall i think this game will maybe top all the others granted that some things look good and that the game is meant to have a slew of new features and add that odd ds 3d element it should be a good game but i hate how its getting 10s before its even released how can you review something that is yet to be released unless you guys all got an early edition this happens all the times for games and its so annoying i already reserved both blackwhite and i cant wait now there is 649 pokemon that is too much but i dont care i love pokemon its coming out march 20 4 months to go theres millions of new pokemon in pokemon black  i like feraligatr i totaly wil get pokemon black they have a whole series of pokemon with new moves i had pokemon soul silver and it was really great pokemon rock and pokemon black rocks hard core so i recamend i cant wait for this to come out i first found out about it when my friend told me about it and then i did some research and discovered that there would be a new genartion so i decided to get black because the legendarie reshiram looked beast how are they not running out of ideas yet theres well over 500 pokemon now anyways im definitely getting both games especially now that theres a reason for getting them having a map exclusively in each game more reasons to get the game is a new battle system triple battles a 3d style city and of course new pokemon pros\\n this massive monitor turns heads at the office\\n my eyes no longer need to refocus to switch monitors ive got one giant continuous screen that acts like 3 monitors\\n split screen for running two computers mix this with synergy or another app to allow keyboard  mouse sharing\\n\\ncons\\n really big you need a sturdy desk or the monitor will shake when you type  move your mouse  sneeze\\n you need a solid video card to game on this beast\\n warzone puts the minimap in the far left corner and i couldnt find it at first  \\n split screen doesnt remember my settings my second computer always displays on the right until i swap them manually in the settings\\n some apps slack dont let you share only part of the screen this review was collected as part of a promotion i use my monitor for gaming love the graphics and response speed this review was collected as part of a promotion great choice for the immersive gaming experience  my son plays games like mincraft gta pubg etc and this monitor had all the specs necessary this review was collected as part of a promotion i would give it to my son for his gaming and im pretty sure he will love it this review was collected as part of a promotion i usually use this tv for gaming and watching movies never get tired of watching this review was collected as part of a promotion games movies have good time the tv is the best for games this review was collected as part of a promotion i use this monitor to play my video games all night before bed let me tell you this is honestly one of the best monitors ive used you could never go wrong with samsung i have a whole line of samsung products the best this review was collected as part of a promotion typically i dont purchase stuff like this but overall i dont regret the purchase i think the quality of the odyssey is pretty good good screen quality and pretty good size for the monitor this review was collected as part of a promotion there is no better way to play red dead 2 than on this monitor this review was collected as part of a promotion the monitor works as i expected as i mainly use it for gaming and the display is very good and the graphics is good for what it is i havent been  disappointed so far this piece is recommended for anyone whos a true and long time steve austin or attitude erawwe fan i am glad i was able to pick it up cause it celebrates both in unique way i had been wanting one for a while the best game i ever bought twice the first one got scratched amazing product and thats the bottom line cuz stone cold said so this was my 1st intro into the fallout series and i must say that i have fallen in love its fun the open world doesnt take you so far away from the story that you forget where youre supposed to be going and the story is very immersive even on easy it provides a decent enough challenge that you cant just run and gun your way through the story the drawbacks are that for a ps4 game the facial expressions and general animations arent the best quite a few controls have to be found out by yourself the tutorial doesnt even mention them it is a little buggy a screwdriver floating in the air but it actually gives the game character and doesnt take away from the game at all ultimately because of a few minor things i cant give it a 5 but this is a must experience oh heck yeah my favorite wrestler in wwe in attitude era and now officially as funko pop my son loves all of the fallout games he has them for 3 different game consoles now great stone cold pop great addition to any collection great open world playground in first or third person amazing game only complaint i have is that you can’t side with every faction and do every mission in one run or without creating a save that you will go back to also there are some missions that can’t be completed after starting some missions other than that amazing game with amazing free roam and exploration and amazing story and missions in my opinion love this game this game has so many new mechanics and a huge open world that force you to get involved in the story there are bugs in the game but still a better game than fallout 76 it’s single player and you have access to many mods that makes the game fun and never dull my husband can’t stop playing this game  he has not given me a chance to play yet when i finally get a chance to play i am sure i will enjoy it as much as he does good game but i wish i had more to interact with it takes time to get used to but it’s one of the best open world games what makes it stand out personally is not knowing what to expect other open world games are repetitive to where you may start to get bored before completing the game this one will wake you up if you start to fall asleep i was happy for this to come out when i found out that you could play with more than one players yes when playing it the story was too guessable not very long or build up good to play with friends but lacks the storyline and build up what until dawn had the heart beat thing they had was not very easy felt like at points they wanted you to get caught not much time to explore very story driven lots of long cut scenes sometimes switching players on local coop can get confusing when trying to figure out which controller is active when responding to quick time events plot is intriguing to me so far but i havent finished the story yet very short and lackluster plot this is a ‘rent’ title at absolute best great game with replay value cant wait for more games from the dark pictures story if you like until dawn then you will love this game very nice game that you can play with other people the  game is great i let my son play and i sit back and watch its like watching a movie great all around game play   so far i preferuntil dawnif their is a comparison to be made pretty awesome and intense game i played the never alone mode with my three sons and although it was nice to finally be able to play games with them rather than having to play with strangers online it was often a good while before it was my turn but it was fun watching each other and suggesting reactions and replies to the popup queries the ending kinda sucked but i saw it coming i am wondering if changing my game play decisions and response to the ques would change the outcome that much guess i will try that and find out looking forward to the next game with them that they foretold at the end of this one looks promising great i love that the game doesnt navigate too much if u miss an object or dont throughly check something you just miss it more of that would be nice i love the difficulty of the checks i wish u could run tho graphics r good good jump scares it’s an amazing game with a great plot and pretty good characters i still like until dawn better but i’m just super attached to the characters in my opinion until dawns characters are just more likable than man of medan’s still an awesome game though i am so glad i bought this game i didnt pick up doom last year so i was new jumping into this game i was skeptical too so i watched all of the early access reviews and heard all about the low res graphics and framerate issues but now those reviews feel like pc gamer gripes 30 fps at whatever blah blah resolution feel like butter and look really amazing scaled down on a smaller screen docked mode not so much but it never soured my experience this is a great port if you havent played doom or if you just want it on the go you wont be disappointed this game is a must have for nintendo switch owners and at first 60 bucks kinda didnt sit right with me but seeing how much work went into getting a game this demanding to run on the switch it is very much worth the price of admission if you love your switch then buy this game today right now im clapping my hands for panic button i cant wait to see what they port next this review was collected as part of a promotion the energizer max alkaline d batteries 2 pack was just what my flashlight needed the energizer max alkaline d batteries 2 pack made the light real bright which is what you want batteries to do when you push that button

i’m excited because now i don’t have to worry about my remote controls dying this review was collected as part of a promotion we go through batteries having three boys in the house we have lots of toys and other things that require batteries i used to buy the cheapest batteries but the energizer max has become a staple in our home no more cheap batteries here this review was collected as part of a promotion we go through batteries in our home like water i have the energizer max d2 pack and boy did i need them we keep flashlights in every bedroom plus under the sink for emergencies during a recent storm my flashlight died and of course no spare batteries for it hence the energizer d size are now in my flashlight powerful bright light and they have a 10 yr shelf life energizer is the only brand we use so having a durable strong long lasting battery is a necessity thank you energizer the name alone means quality products will be stocking up on more of all sizes this review was collected

performance powerful cells this review was collected as part of a promotion these are by far our favorite batteries  the durability and lastability is incredible  wonderful product  we used these in our large flashlight and they were great  the light appeared to be much brighter than with the other batteries weve used this review was collected as part of a promotion i was going through batteries like crazy before these seem to do the trick in stopping that they last forever and have a great shelf life we added a few extras to our emergency bag  well worth the buy this review was collected as part of a promotion we can always rely on energizer batteries \\r\\nthe energizer max batteries in d are fabulous  i’m using these in our flashlight and they’re lighting up the night  \\r\\nsimple to install and much brighter than the ones we had in previously  \\r\\nthe max definitely last longer and save money  they’re brighter and you can really tell the difference  when it comes to brand names buying energizer batteries is truly worth every penny  \\r\\ni want my flashlights to work every time and to be bright and reliable  when i grab one it’s often because other lighting has failed or i’m in need of light in a dark place  i don’t want weak waning light  \\r\\ngrab the energizer max batteries and see the difference for yourself  you won’t go back this review was collected as part of a promotion i have flashlights in several spots in our home i case the power goes out and energizer is a brand i know and trust the one in my room was dimmer than the others until i swapped out the batteries for these now it’s back to full force and i can rest easy knowing how well these work and that i can depend on them when to work when i need it to this review was collected as part of a promotion i needed these batteries so bad thought i could save money and recently bought a pack of d batteries and they didnt work these energizer max alkaline d batteries work amazing and i know that they will last us tip dont go cheap on batteries when you need them energizer batteries arent cheap or too expensive they are affordable and work amazing constantly glitches  none of the special benefits showed up and im constantly stuck with a nag  weapons selection keeps changing randomly without command  constantly swaps server and loses progress and randomly loses stuff  its like playing a game from the 1980s frustrating as censored for profanity this was such an awesome game it really got you to not only appreciate the story but the lay of the lands and how beautiful the game is but the game play is satisfying too i think this would be the best game for the true pokefans such as myself no doubt about that i would recomend this game to anyone who has played the pokemon series from the original gold and silver to herat gold and soul silver and everything inbetween not including the pokemon rangers i would setinly buy this game and any other pokemon game like this i think this will be the game of the year for any pokefan i cant wait to get it im so excited yayyyyyy pokemon this game has so much hype behind it with the former release of heart gold and soul silver from the looks of it the game looks better than both games all the new pokemon will give players a whole new arsenal of weapons this game will be great and i cant wait for its release in 2011 this game is going to be great the camera angles the new battle system the new leveling system plus the 3d cities its going to be great with the new 3ds plus the live caster feature with dsi dsixl and 3ds is going to be cool when pokemon black and white were first announced near the beginning of 2010 i knew i had to get my hands on a copy surely enough following its release in japan i held a copy of it in my own hands just a few days later now 412 hours into the game at least says my ds i can safely assure you that this game is nothing short of fantastic gamefreak has outdone themselves with this new duo improving upon the classical formula that we all came to love over a decade ago the new 3d layout of the graphics is nice and very aesthetically pleasing at moments while many would be surprised the continued use of the 2d sprites actually fits quite well in the new overworld battles are more fluid inbattle pokemon now have fluid animation continuously throughout the battle comparable to the beginning animation you used to see for a brief second or two when sending out a pokemon in the previous games the camera moves around slightly keeping your attention to the battle wondering what view it may pan to next the difficulty is not too hard some may find that the final challenge in the story is rather easy but thats not a big concern for there is a long aftergame segment in fact there are even multiple cities that are unavailable until the story has been completed the number of pokemon continues to increase as this generation adds a whopping 156 new ones the most ever to be added in a single generation surpassing even the originals the audio is clear the pokemon cries are now extremely unique and interesting and the music tracks are outstanding while i cant be certain there are likely more music tracks in this game than any previous one of the series having shown my friends this game on my ds ive yet to find a single one that has not been intrigued or interested in this game with new moves new pokemon and a fresh new outlook on the game pokemon black is a mustbuy next year pokemon black and white have improved greatly compared to the past generationsits cool how when you send your pokemon out it moves the whole battlethere are many new features and i believe that it will sell more than heart gold and soul silver im getting both black will be my main and ill get snivythe english name for the grass starter on white ill get tepigthe fire starter they have released the english names for the starters snivygrass tepigfireoshawottwater i cant wait for this game to come out i have seen the game play on youtube and i know its going to be great if you are a pokemon fan i highly recomend it ok people obviously from the other reviews ive read nobodyknows when the game will be outits out on march 20 2011 ive been watching on youtube a walkthrough of the game and its pretty sweet sofar i mean the camera angles change huge improvement on the 3d efffects anyway already preordered it paid full price best be gettin my pokemon on not ony is it a great game but they make the leveling system much more difficult which is good to me cause its a challenging goal to reach and nobody wants an easy walk through the park pokemon gamethe graphics are amazingyou wll be mesmerized by the bridgesthe pokemon are so differentthis game will feed your hunger for adventure i just did my research and found something that everyone will want to hear i did my research and found out that for the dp episodes out of all they had only ten remain that means 10 weeks 2 12 months this officially means that starting on jan 22 the official start of the new season pokemon bw will be launched and that means only abot 23 months to the games pokemon black and white version hope it

really use it but my grandchild does and let me say she loves it she uses it everyday after school to do her homework and when shes done she plays games it runs fast and never really breaks down and if she loves it i love it this review was collected as part of a promotion this monitor is amazing even if you can only run it at 1080p do run it at the full ar or the light bleed will be terrible as the lighting zones arent the best if you want to avoid this issue you might go with the newer g9 neo\\n\\nthe aspect ratio makes games like halo infinite and doom look amazing\\n\\nthis monitor has also increased my productivity when i work allowing for a huge workspace on my macbook this review was collected as part of a promotion for gaming and streaming\\nlove the look of the screen this review was collected as part of a promotion so initially i got this for the high resolution and space for my gaming setup this monitor is everything you could ever want after playing multiple games on pc as well as ps5 on this monitor i noticed a massive immersive experience\\nthe colors really lly bring out your visual eye candy also the rgb light on the back makes a cool background light for sgowing off i was so impressed i bought 2 haha i love samsung products i feel their innovative products are the future this review was collected as part of a promotion it appears to be up to par with the best gaming monitors available this review was collected as part of a promotion i use is for many everyday thing but my favorite is the gaming experience for me \\ncrystal clear resolution just amazing you will not regret getting this game even if your new to the series a must play my grandkids enjoy this more than i my reflexes are not what it takes to play this game i just plug away at it i got this a while after it came out but is still a great game my son thoroughly enjoyed the fall out series another classic definitely a long term game to play and the storylines and choices keep you on your feet for the price this game is well worth the price lots of action and good graphics suggest everyone try this game it worked perfectly for about two minutes before it froze then a window appeared on the screen saying that the disc cannot be played and had to be removed the disc looked fine no scratches no smudges i restarted my ps4 and tried again but the same thing happened when i bought it a black sticker was covering gamestops price sticker on the case so i peel it off and instead of the price i see the words defective and at the bottom send to warehouse gamestop intentionally sold me their junk i literally paid for garbage\\r\\n\\r\\ni was really excited to play fallout 4 the 1 star review is not meant to reflect the quality of the game but of my experience shopping with gamestop one of the last few games that does not have a continuous line of fees to continue through the game great game suffers from some performance issues and has bugs like any other bethesda game very intuitive game play graphics are very good but not great early in the game but love it so far this game is like playing a movie i didinr initially like that you couldn’t immediately go back and replay a flubbed area but that adds to the realism and some pucker moments great game so for a game 30 i would say buying it at that price is pretty much a good deal the story is good the deaths are fun and the fact this only part one in a series allows me confidently give this game a good rating the only thing holding it back is that the average playthrough is 6 hours but that does not include the other story options again i would recommend this to anyone one but for horror fans this game is a perfect bite honestly i enjoyed this game it was fun and i liked that i was able to play online wa buddy of mine having said that the ending came about too quickly and i accidentally ending up saving all but 1 character which i was pleased with but it was all just too easy it only took like 25hrs to complete  also if you choose to play online with a friend be prepared for important scenes of dialogue to end abruptly i won’t explain whyhow i think that happens because it may give away the plot but i’m hoping that by the time “little hope” is released the developers have fixed that glitch  \\nmaybe i was thinking back too much on “until dawn” and comparing this to that but i guess i just expected more havent played movie night yet heard it was good but good game on single player i love these type is games great gameplay short story though i loved it its not bad like everyone saying it is if you like games like this you will like this one to replay value is sky high choice system is again solid cinematic value is incredible until dawn evolved great job story was solid characters werent boring to play as graphics could have been better for a modern generation game bit of stutters here and there in the beginning the voice acting is kinda cheesy but as it goes on you tend to ignore it and pay more attention to your surroundings other than its graphic problems and voice acting i loved it i really enjoyed this game and i would recommend this to anyone who loves horror in order of my game values \\r\\n\\r\\nnarrative was expecting more overall it’s ok for 4 hours just massive horror tropes nothing special character depth very weak storytelling average \\r\\n\\r\\ngameplay playables move like tanks qte are decent but repetitive and nothing new would have never did a second play though from the beginning incredibly slow and not entertaining chapter selection available after first \\r\\n\\r\\ngraphics for a major def far from what you would expect from a 2019 big budget game frame rate drops bugs bad acting \\r\\n\\r\\nreally hope the second title will learn from this flop until dawn seems far more advanced if it doesn’t get better i doubt will get the third title\\r\\n\\r\\ni did not play movie or coop mn seems fun with friends coop sounds interesting \\r\\n\\r\\noverall i don’t regret my time spent on it and made all 5 survive with 1 playthrough  2 chapter selects at the very end not worth full price ok to buy used and have some nice jumps but very far from titles side as detroit heavy rain le until dawn which still needs work but was fine for the year and moment it came out  just to stay in the same ballpark great game i screwed up some qtes quick time events resulting in some losing some characters just like until dawn i will have replay some chapters to get better results love it this review was collected as part of a promotion my house goes through so many batteries of every kind ive tried pretty much every kind of batteries out there and hands down the energizer max alkaline d batteries 2 pack batteries last way longer then the other brands of d batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion the energizer max  alkaline d batteries last much longer than other batteries they work extremely well for a long time i highly recommend these batteries they work in a variety of products and work great this review was collected as part of a promotion i love the energizer max alkaline d batteries  they are long lasting  i am glad they come in a 2 pack because its rare for me to need d batteries  when i do need d batteries i usually only need 2 at a time so this is a perfect pack for me  i love energizer batteries  i highly recommend these this review was collected as part of a promotion i love the 2pack d2 energizer max batteries because it you dont use them right away they have a 10 year shelf life so i feel comfortable storing them until i actually have a need to use them the packaging is excellent and the batteries are just what i needed because im out of d2 batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion my sons talking flashlight has gone through so many batteries this last year until we got energizer most batteries stopped working in a month and these are still going strong months later i am so happy with them and wont be buying anything else i highly recommend them for everything that takes batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion i am happy with how long these batteries hold their charge  i use them in a water fountain and it runs for about 6 hours daily  these lasted the entire week i was surprised because the brand i was using only lasts little more than half that and costs the same  these energizers are a definite money saver for my house  i will certainly purchase more of these and keep them in stock the batteries work great i have a flashlight that takes 3 of these so i need to pick this up for when the power goes out they are more expensive but worth it this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer batteries are the best to keep on hand for all extra gadgets and necessary products you dont think about until it really matters our smoke alarms batteries always seem to die in the middle of the night and having spare batteries on hand is so important for keeping our family safe we love energizer batteries as they last longer than the other brands and keep their charge for years we are always pleased with how long they last while in use and when we do need to grab a new one they are always good this review was collected as part of a promotion i got these in june i wanted to really use them and see so i put them in a flashlight then swapped to a battery powered radio they are still going these are the best batteries i’ve ever used i’d rather get these than pay for rechargeable batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries work great the energizer max alkaline d batteries are yet another step in perfecting the long lasting battery better than its predecessor and definitely better than other brands i use them in my black light flashlight which i use nightly for hunting scorpions and its been over 2 months they going strong my new favorite brand definitely will buy again weak game graphics weren’t even that spectacular and the gameplay was weak af no clue what the objective was had to go wandering around for more time than i would have liked to get to the next stage which never feels like a good enough payoff for the time invested terrible game sold it after 1 day this game is very fun and very challenging going from place to place and reaching the destinations these pokemon games look really sweet if you like the pokemon franchise then you should get it these games are really different from the previous ones yet they are the same these games are those games that never get old the new pokemon look awesome and new features that have never been seen in previous games also if you choose pokemon white you dont get to see black city you get to see the white forest and if you choose pokemon black you dont get to see white forest but you get to see black city so you got to choose which one you want to see white forest or black city also the 4 stations are present winter autumn summer and fall each one appearing in different months a new one every month throughout the year every station lasts one month and comes back on another month and pokemon are available depending on the station unaccesible areas depending on the station as well these are some of the features the games come with i hope this is helpful to you all ive been waiting for this game ever sinces pokemon heart gold and soul silver came out its gonnna be so cool the graphic are very good there gonna have a dragon in ervery type thats cool and you cand save you game file online the coolest this games gonna be good  perfect incredable gamplay a need for any hardcore gamergamers unite i played the jaan version and beat it the last battles are epic the gyms are better to play and the starters are sweet plus i like how they made from a new point of view like its almost at level with it plus the cities are better especily the main city the triple battles are sweet too because they can allow you to switch out your pokemon this is why this is the best pokemongame ever i played the japanese version and although i couldnt not understand the story specifics the storyline is very different than before and it is an amazing change no boringness between towns and great changes have been added to the game ive watched japanese reviews on youtube and the game looks really well done the thing i like about this one that they lacked about the last few ones before diamondpearlplatinum was they made the grass pokemon look really awesomethe grass type has always been the least favorite in the area im from fire and water were always chosen im not a fan of the water pokemon in this game though so my choices will be grass and fireanother thing the pokemon company needs to change is the type of fire starter pokemon we get this is the 3rd time in a row weve gotten a firefighter torchiccombuskenblazikenchimcharmonfernoinfernapepokaboo chaoboo and enbuoh starter pokemon it gets pretty tiring after a while but im sure im going to use the new leaf pokemon first cant wait for this game to drop i like pokemon games and i think this will be a great game to play do to all the new pokemon and features i got more info the game includes an area called the dream world its a place where you can catch and see pokemon from other regions the pokemon contest will be brought back into gameplay and you can earn a total of 68 ribbons for each pokemon also two new battle colleseums and a new battle style will be added to the new region the battle subway united tower and the triple battle the subway is a sircular station to battle other various com trainers and possibly travel from region to region the united tower has 130 floors with a stronger trainer on each floor for you to battle against the triple battle is where three pokemon are on one side of the field in a battle against another three a new version of pal park is also coming the new pokeshifter feature basicly it works like pal park but instead of an area to walk around in its a minigame where pokemon are hiding in bushes and you need to shoot them with a pokeball when they pop out more info about the dream world includes the dream isle many normal grass and other forest based pokemon like pikachu apear there where you can play minigames and befriend them hte two new legendaries zekrom and reshiram have had their new stats updated too everything is the same but the atk and spatk reshiram has 120 atk and 150 spatk but zokrom has 150 atk and 120 spatk it seems as though pokemon has finally used that ace theyve been hiding up their sleeve i mean black and white this is sounding an awful lot like the end this review was collected as part of a promotion i watch movies and i just love how clear the picture is this review was collected as part of a promotion i use it for movies and to play games i love when i play games and the view is realistic and very hd this review was collected as part of a promotion i have two of these monitors vertically stacked the top one upside down for the least amount of bezel between  depending on what im doing for work i run it partitioned either three up top and two bottom or two and two or three and three this has really made my job so much more efficient having this much screen real estate requiring only a glance rather than having to keep alt tabbing  the curved monitor keeps the distance a lot closer to your eyes regardless of where you look at and it really does make it easier for those long grueling days  easy on the eyes good color equal brightness throughout the panel im really happy with this purchase this review was collected as part of a promotion sharp view easy controls works across the board with any brands very well love samsung products this review was collected as part of a promotion this monitor allows for an insane wide angled viewing experience it allows me to have all my tabs open on different parts of the screen this monitor also allows my desk setup to look cleaner because i have less monitors to clutter it if you are looking into a large ultra wide monitor this is especially for gaming this review was collected as part of a promotion bought this for my xbox series x and it performs and looks amazing it looks really great and great for switching between my xbox and pc this review was collected as part of a promotion mostly for gaming wide be angle colors are even better then most monitors this review was collected as part of a promotion i use two monitors in addition to my samsung crg9 which is my main i mainly use for games and its amazing but not a real advantage to first person shooter games its more for the emmersive effect and its great with the high refresh rate it makes games feel great such as call of duty overwatch etc \\n\\nfor work its awesome and great for productivity work i have three screens but with the 49 inch its like having four monitors highly recommend my son loves it at the part were he found his son this review was collected as part of a promotion the fact that i can coordinate my neck and eyes more instead of staring straight ahead with a basic monitor i love this game already i haven’t even played it too caught up on skyrim special edition this review was collected as part of a promotion this monitor is phenomenal the immersion factor when gaming is breathtaking and the productivity capabilities are unmatched contrary to many of my peers i ended up enjoying this fallout more than the previous two iterations of the franchise it’s everything you’d want in a open postapocalyptic nuclear world  it’s a big world out there and you are right in the middle of it so much to do it’s hard to figure out where to start but once you get the hang of it it’s pretty easy it was a good game but quickly became boring as 90 of the game is traveling between points and hoping to not get raided by deathclaws op great game if you just want to wonder the world finding stuff to do 55 for sure no lie good fun not as good as new vegas but fun in its own ways good game if you want to gaint idiot in power armor i havent played very much of it yet but i like what i see this review was collected as part of a promotion a week ago my mothers area had a blackout she didnt want to leave her home but needed batteries for her radio i put the energizer maxs in and the radio lasted for the 48 hrs her lights were off great product i will be changing over to the energizer max batteries for my flashlights and other

love the battery kept my light brighter and stay on long thank u for sending me the d cell battery i love all my samples i get to try  well it was a perfect night to try that’s batterie for the manterm this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries are reliable they have a long shelf life and dependable i put them in my flashlight three months ago and they are cb still going strong and i get the brightest light i have had no problems with leakage either this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries have been working great for my family they seem to last longer than most others usually do i definitely appreciate that considering batteries aren’t cheap if i was to choose a brand over the other i would choose this one for sure this review was collected as part of a promotion i was happy to get and use the energizer max alakline d batteries  with grandchildren we are always in need of batteries and they never seem to last long enough  well these did  still are  well be purchasing energizer max more often for our household this review was collected as part of a promotion so glad to have the energizer max alkaline d batteries for my flashlight it now shines bright as it can get they seem very dependable  they fit perfectly  the packaging kept them secure energizer is my goto brand this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries are definitely energizer batteries because they last and last we go through lots of batteries around here with a 5 and 7 year old these have been used in a popular game around our household for weeks and i dont think theyll need to be replaced anytime soon  this review was collected as part of a promotion i picked these up about a month ago and put them in a flashlight that had dead batteries the flashlight has worked perfectly since i was inspired to upgrade the bulb to an led bulb and that has worked out well  the flashlight is much brighter than the old bulb and the energizers have not trouble powering the led this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer batteries are a brand name that you can trust when it comes to batteries they always seem to last the longest which means less money spent i have two young sons and were always using batteries for their various toys weve bought the cheap brands and nothing compares to energizer thought i was getting a green controller but turns out that both editions show up with an image of the green controller so while yes i should have been paying attention it seems a little sketchy that you cant even take a picture of the black controller and set up the right picture for it also didnt have any emails from the company until it arrived no order confirmation nothing that would have let me see my error until i opened the box it came in a perfect example of a classic staple and a musthave for any and all true og xbox fansplayers great controller for those of us with big hands  hate the shoulder buttons this broke less then 1 month after purchase analog sticks malfunctioned completely and do not work i do not recommend purchasing this controller it brings memories back of having original xbox controller but in the end that is all you have memories with no controller i do wish it were a pro controller with extra mappable trigger buttons but i do love this thing i’ve got big hands so for me it’s quite comfortable the second triggers are a bit oddly placed as well but very manageable to use i also love the look and the little screen on the controller way cool revamp of a thrown back legendary controller great for people with big hands \\r\\nbutton layout actually helps for fighting games imo \\r\\nsuper nostalgic with the og xbox load screen \\r\\nonly downside is that it’s not wireless works great a little big so may not fit in everyones hands has many awesome features from playing the xbox start up animation upon hitting the home butten to adding small bumpers for more convenient play had to return it a few times cuz the connecting part is fragile and disconnects midgame sometimes  didnt realize it was a duke made by a third party or hyperkin  probably wouldve reconsidered since the quality is just not there this thing brings back so many memories it works perfectly and the led screen built in that displays the original xbox boot screen is an excellent touch fantastic quality it is a perfect recreation of the classic xbox controller with some improvements the triggers feel more modern the thumb sticks are grippier the shoulder buttons feel as good as they could its silly but the home button screen animation is very satisfying to watch every time you press the button even though i have small hands i really love this controller i cant explain it its just comfortable this sim is not ready for prime time when it worked i loved the graphics and the realism but no matter how much i tried and it seems many others it just kept crashing dont do it unless you have a high end gaming computer because the frustration of getting it to work will drive the pleasure of it right out of you it’s a bit laggy if you don’t have a good computer i cant get over how immersive this simulator is i love this game so realistic i didn’t know the what the controls were for my joystick and i crashed 5 stars its a beautiful game but i have found some elements to be a bit kludgy others parts of the userflow to be less than intuitive \\r\\nstill excited to find time to fly more this review was collected as part of a promotion amazing for both work and play

dedicate to gaming this was a perfect game littles short and clunky but entertaining none the less i played both movie and solo mode of course movie with a partner there were a lot jump scares and it

review was collected as part of a promotion what else do we care about batteries besides how long they last well these last as long as any longer than the amazon brand cheapies theyve lasted at least twice as long so far and also are not oozing battery acid 1010 would buy again this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer max alkaline d batteries are clearly the best batteries  the power is immediately obvious  the batteries are heavy from being packed with a lot of power  so far i have seen no decrease in power iver time  i am excited to finally have a battery that will last the entire weekend in my cd player this review was collected as part of a promotion you can never go wrong with energizer batteries they have never failed me i keep these with my camping gear for lanterns and flashlights theyve never given me trouble and always seem to last longer than expected this review was collected as part of a promotion i am so happy i was given the chance to try out enegizer max alkaline d batteries as we all know batteries can be very expensive so i was excited i was able to test them out for free i used the d batteries in one of my remotes for a drone and they have stood the test of time working great and still going strong this review was collected as part of a promotion as usual energizer is the best and always has been i have always bought the energizer brand  batteries because they have always been the top quality brand batteries on the market and well worth the money for their price i have and always will recommend these to my friends and family thanks for letting me tryit it was okay somewhat futuristic and it wasnt really my style still a great game after being out for however long it’s been been out great game single player no coop or online play it’s basically you and npc’s very fun game plot is very good no complaints at all the mutants are too badass for me but i love it i wish postnuclear games were more in production than the zombiepandemic stuff i run out of ammo too soon though good game love the fallout lineup fulfilled expectations awesome game graphics are phenomenal and story is great long game still playing beautiful detail in game lengthy game with many options to choose from nice storyline one of the best games ever made so many amazing mods to tear the game to your liking over a hundred hours of game play and reasons to play this over many times to make different choices this was my favorite fallout cause i love building stuff and with mods i could build a lot even though i intentionally bought this as a collectors item i had to use it acouple times to feel the nostalgia of original xbox days i have a bit bigger hands and having been molded from the original xbox controller which i loved for this reason it fits very comfortably in my hands  i love the color i have a thing for green and the light up parts are a nice touch  im also quite fond of the little display in the middle that plays the original xbox start up sequence  i love this little beast i love this remote its very responsive and it feels just like the old xbox remote ive played shooting and fighting games with it and aside from me getting used to the shift in buttons it i really enjoyed it awesomefeel cant stoo using it over my wireless the only thing they could improve is add wireless version this is a almost perfect reproduction as the original duke they really nailed the feel and how on some games it does take a while to get used to the addition of the right and left bumpers actually helps out a lot i kinda wish microsoft would let them use the wireless for this bumper buttons are to far apart from triggers makes for difficult gaming absolutely love the look and feel of this controller do not like the cord being detachable and with it being plugged in my headset causes a buzzing feedback for any friends in my party started off as a novelty but quickly became one of my favorite controllers this infamous pad really has nice feel this controller is not for everyone and not practical from most games have found some usefulness in a few titles due to the black and white buttons which replicate the left and right bumpers which are not very ergonomic in their placement nonetheless a great replica as a fan of the original it’s a great nostalgia piece not good at all very weak control for the price they asking this review was collected as part of a promotion when you use the pc  the graphics are awesome you see your movies games and streaming in top quality the processor in it is amazing a never had a buffering issue unless it is on my side this review was collected as part of a promotion i love the wrap around screen it makes it feel so real this review was collected as part of a promotion i use it for movies and gaming and the graphics is immaculate this review was collected as part of a promotion i love the curve to it feels like im surrounded and in a deep dive gaming mode the color is so vividly extraordinary its hard to describe number one best purchase for my gaming station this review was collected as part of a promotion the screen is just to big but the quality and picture are

i would recommend this product to anyone this monitor is perfect and there are so many settings to play around with colors and picture look crisp punchy and smooth love everything about this monitor except one thing i would need to know if this monitor is capable of 1440p at 120hz i have trying to get it on my xbox series x with all different settings on and off etc nothing works if anyone knows how to be able to get it to set at 1440p 120hz would be greatly appreciated if it is able to at all this review was collected as part of a promotion i use my monitor for gaming and samsung provided a better experince because they allow you to use many awesome features this review was collected as part of a promotion gaming and tvexcellentnice productlove the smart features this review was collected as part of a promotion i love it my samsung monitor for gaming love to play specially curve screen great start for this anthology the emotions are a little stiff but voice acting and storyline is great good game allot of jump scares i like you can play it again with different results and you can play it with a group of friends together i love these types of games  the multiple different ways it can be played through multiple endings  jumped at some points which was fun my complaint was at times the movement of the characters was not very smooth the controls get a little clunky but its a good spiritual successor to until dawn dumb fun story is absolutely bonkers but the character interactions and decisions and choices are a blast definitely play multiplayer very interactive love the suspense and decision making affecting the outcome of the game so many endings to look forward to i like this game a lot was fun to watch and now that i beat it im going to try other ways to see all possible out cimes supermassive is definitely doing a great job in separating themselves from other developers who make story decisions games awesome game just a little short but alot of replayability not too scary just some jump scares here and there great for anyone who has thumbs drags in the beginning has a boring plot didnt kill any of my characters the assigning of characters to players were a fun idea but unfortunately the story didnt hold up hopefully the next one isnt so disappointing this review was collected as part of a promotion we have been using these batteries for a baby sleeper to play music very constantly they have lasted a long time and have not disappointed i recommend these batteries for all your needs especially ones like baby items that can make you very frantic if the batteries run out and you do not have anymore on hand this review was collected as part of a promotion my son burns through batteries pretty fast in his rc cars these really seem to last a long time and the cats seem to keep their power the whole time  he’s satisfied and not bugging me for more constantly  thumbs up this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries save so much time and trouble compared to other brands they have been put to use for 3 weeks now and have not died yet  whereas the previous batteries have seem to died out the first week of use this review was collected as part of a promotion these are the best batteries i have ever used in my life  they are so strong and durable  they last for a long period of time and do not fail  compared to other batteries the energizer max alkaline batteries are the best on the market  if you have electronic toys etcthat require heavy duty power then these are the batteries for you this review was collected as part of a promotion best batteries for the cost and lifetime of the battery   i wont buy another brand as the energizer brand is so dependable and long lasting  i never have to worry about a dead battery after just a few uses this review was collected as part of a promotion i received the alkaline d batteries in a 2 pack i got them for my daughters toy they were easy to put in and the batteries have lasted a very long time i would definitely recommend alkaline batteries they are my number one go to battery this review was collected as part of a promotion we travel frequently as a family and with extended family members  wherever we stay we typically need to use an air mattress or two to provide enough beds for everyone  this battery has been used many times in a battery powered air pump used to inflate the beds  as the commercial says it keeps going and going this review was collected as part of a promotion when getting energizer you know it will work for a long time these large batteries have been powering my electric trashcan lid for the past few weeks and they are working perfectly no performance issues or degradation at all this review was collected as part of a promotion not sure how long these will continue to last but i put these batteries in a 20yearold boom box and they’ve been going for over a month  happy with this purchase so far  i would like to purchase some double and triple a batteries next to try in my television and xbox remotes to really test their longevity this review was collected as part of a promotion i tried a side by side comparison with these batteries and another from another national retailer and these ones were actually brighter than the othersin the long run for me it pays to spend a little more for a battery with more power than to buy a cheaper brand when youll spend twice as much replacing them it is a crazy awesome game with a free world to just explore and with a huge story with crazy twists and turns i recommend this game here we have fallout4 ladies and gentlemen once again i’ve picked up this game again and let me tell you it does not ever get old there is absolutely new finds new parts i haven’t been too and let me just say it still gives me the creeps when something pops out of no where overall one of the best games that has been on the console for awhile i love fallout 4 and have the season pass which is awesome great deal for after my pro points 459 cashcant beat that i’m a huge fallout fan so this game peaked my interest great gameplay and so many things to do loved it this is an awsome game i would recomend it to everyone love the game everything about it is good would have given it 5 stars but didnt rlly like the building aspect its a fine enough game but without mods its very bareboned bethesda couldve done a lot more with it in my opinion as its definitely the most aestheticallypleasing fallout unfortunately its also really boring after a couple of playthroughs its an important game to me and my teen years but im afraid i have to give it a three out of five can’t believe i waited until 2019 to check this one outs can’t wait to lose myself in the world it was good but i’m still a obsidian fallout fan but was still very fun the game is very entertaining my wife loves to play also to develop the settlements it was a bit bulky and uncomfortable at first but i got used to it it works well and controls smoothly great throw back to the legend know as the duke very well made and durable i plan on getting every color a great controller exactly how i remember it a little a too big for my hands but that’s part of the nostalgia the screen is a nice touch and i find myself watching it anytime i press it excellent controller long usb cord quality is very high in materials used just like the original controller love it very good controller not receiving for people with small hands this does exactly what i wanted and more the extra bumper buttons take some getting used to but so do having b  w buttons again \\r\\nthe main negatives are the lower analog sensitivity and being not truly wired but not wireless either if they had a black colored that would be even better this is the best original controller for xbox one it feels and plays just like an original one and the lcd start up screen is awsome\\r\\nonly drawback is it is not wireless but the cord that comes with it is pretty long the size is great for my large hands required me to adjust my playing a bit the bumper buttons placement is different than other controllers ive used i had some money left on my eshop and i decided to purchase the update with it it turn out to be pretty cool this review was collected as part of a promotion my job is very hot so i bought a small battery powered fan that runs on 2 d batteries and then some batteries from the dollar store well those batteries did not last very long so i decided to get better ones and i got the energizer max d batteries to try out and they worked great lasting longer and at higher speed than the cheaper ones this review was collected as part of a promotion i finally found batteries that last for a long time  i used

run out but with as little as i use that light i should be good for years i dont know if they have the extended storage life the package says id have to post that review in 10 years but so far these last considerably longer than the standard batteries i usually buy this review was collected as part of a promotion i use it for workstreaminggammin and researchits a great product this review was collected as part of a promotion gaming and movies and alot of different features oneofakind one of my most used devices this review was collected as part of a promotion i use my monitor for school work and play at home i have a 3 monitor setup and this is the centerpiece providing a perfect amount of real estate for almost anything i could need finding a desk mount that was able to support the weight was difficult as this thing is pretty hefty the monitor is substantial but there are a few pieces that felt like they will easily break over time like the back plate that covers the inputs i have had this monitor for about a year now though and so far it has not broken although admittedly i have not taken it off and put it on a lot in that time i havent experienced the light bleed that some have experienced on this monitor so far as i can tell fps gaming on games like cod warzone is amazing on this thing and being able to comfortably have several windows up simultaneously is awesome as well i am not a fan of the lighting zones tho during dark scenes with certain conditions the zones are very apparent with illuminated stripes going down the monitor but in my use case this doesnt happen often this review was collected as part of a promotion it was great my boss got it for his son but before he give it to him for his gaming and we got to play with it and man it was great i was feeling like i was in the game all around view love it  this review was collected as part of a promotion this monitor is perfect in every aspect it has a great color accuracy high refresh rate for gamers and aslo very wide for multitasking this review was collected as part of a promotion monitor is good for stocks the curve and width is outstanding why use two monitors when you have one that can do it i cant wait to see what samsung has for next year this review was collected as part of a promotion i love how wide this monitor is i also love how it fits your field of view more than a traditional monitor because of the curve its aesthetic is also amazing looks really good this review was collected as part of a promotion i use the monitor for gaming the sound works well it feels smooth whe i play i miss nothing this review was collected as part of a promotion crystal clear quality perfect for gaming couldnt get over to grab i was p\\nblown away this review was collected as part of a promotion it is an amazing screen that i personally use for gaming and it does phenomenally for gaming with high reduction and refresh rate i get to meet dogmeat the k9 i found at the gas station and codworths who keeps complaining about cleaning my house it’s like skyrim on account of it being a bethesda game there’s first person and third person shooting options and the hame is long and has many missions and side missions you get to explore the world in search of someone important this game is awesome but it’s basically a remake of fallout 3  similar plot same music same combat etc not a fallout type of person but this game is great fallout 4 has great graphics it also has an interesting story line the best part about it is the customization available for weapons armor power armor and bases i like the unique charcters and creatures in the game and the lore behind it all excellent game but too many glitches to give it a 5 star rating fun shooter with so much to do that the main missions become secondary my favorite game of all time and still play today i love the fallout series and the fourth one in the franchise lives up to my expectations my only complaint is i would like a bit more variety in the music on diamond city radio or at least stop playing butcher pete so often this review was collected as part of a promotion the performance of the energizer max alkaline d batteries is quite impressive  during the summer we are always bringing radios poolside for entertainment  with the volume up its easy to go through batteries quickly  i was happily surprised to get

than the regular batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion i have went through so many different brands of batteries from kids toys to remote controls for the tv  im always changing back to these batteries because of the price and how long they last by the time you purchase multiple packs of the generic batteries you could of purchased less packs of this brand so stop wasting time and money  and just purchase energizer this review was collected as part of a promotion i have an old emergency light that requires d batteries i had a bad thunderstorm and our power went out i

shadows its like the monitor cant adjust so dark is the only option the player has \\nthe only thing that took some getting use to was the curved screen and even that wasnt but a couple of days so i would call that a good thing this review was collected as part of a promotion i play pc gaming  aswell  as streaming  with daul screen  love 240hz fast response  time with 1000nit hdr a dream come true thank for installing headphones  jack  great job  love how this monitor  wrap around you it like u in side the game this review was collected as part of a promotion i use my phone for personal use and business purposes  it is amazing and fast this review was collected as part of a promotion movies gaming and videos i love samsung products i love the choose your own adventure style of story telling and i really love the what if scenario and this game lets me experience both  bonus points for having multiplayer option and being able to kill my friends i thought this game was amazing and the story and characters were great has a good twist  that i thought was gonna happen 3 weeks before still an amazing game and would definitely recommend box was well protected and the figure itself is phenomenal couldnt be happier my brother and i have used this controller relentlessly and apart from odd bumper placement this controller is like being a 6 year old again playing halo combat evolved so i got this thing both because of my large hands and because of nostalgia but ive only used it about once first and foremost the wire it comes with is super lowquality and it will disconnect for literally no reason id recommend using or purchasing a ps4 controller charging cord as those work really well on this i would also recommend not using a headset especially a stereo headset with the controller when my controller became disconnected and id reattach the cord my headset would almost always emit a horrifying screeching sound or loud static not joking there the xbox party i was in at the time could also hear it other than the horrifying noises from that the thing works pretty well best controller ever brings back lots of memories of playing the original xbox system i bought this today because i felt nostalgic idk its because im more comfortable with the xbox one controllers of today but playing with this controller is hard if they would have the lb and rb bumpers bigger i can maybe get use to itthe only thing cool on here is the light up thing in the middle i dont know how i played with the original controller back in the day if youre a big fan of the controller then buy it i love the feel when im going retro and playing original xbox games but with seamless transition to modern xbox games as well my only gripe is the lcd screen has so much potential to only play the retro logo and login just seams like a waste of ground breaking potential hyperkin has done xbox gamers everywhere a great service by bringing back the duke this is a real twofisted controller that just feels right in your hands black or transparent green i have both you cant go wrong with the duke the duke feels surprisingly good in your hands after all this time although its big enough it can be a little chunky for extended play  the lcd boot up screen is a fantastic touch  the only issue i have with the controller is one that was fixed for this very reason the black and white buttons are very awkward and impractical to use  they have been supplemented with small square buttons where the lb and rb bumpers would normally be which is a nice addition but theyre not as handy ergonomic or responsive as the true bumpers are on a regular controller great the only thing i would have changed was made it wireless other then that i love it got big hands or just in love with nostalgia this controller is the one for you i was going to get a an after glow initially for my pc saw this beauty and remembered the promo about it and i was taken back with nostalgia and its so great using the of xbox controller on my modern pc its a fantastic controller definitely recommend this one i love this game ive only had it for a couple of days and i cant put it down the gfx are great very good game never a let down with this game  always another random path or something to build to keep it interesting  too bad fallout 76 bombed the series for now what begins with fall and ends with out not this game because technically it ends with a 4 but at the end of the dayit’s frikkin’ fallout 4 such a great game makes the world a better place just to have it out there for people to play from character development to dlc all the way to open world navigation this game has it all packaged up with a postapocalyptic bow to boot it’s been alright it gets pretty tough pretty quick the ghouls are quick to be thrown at you as well as a really early deathclaw it’s a good game if you haven’t played it’s worth a shot hit or miss really controls throw me off every time i switch from another game but just because they’re a little different than most otherwise pretty good nice game to replay if you havent played since launch or great for a first playthrough loads of fun and i believe the updates they have made have improved some performance issues they had in the past plays good on ps4 pro but theres still some slowdown in larger more detailed areas with lots of enemies but stays solid most of the time this is late but it is better than 76 not as good as 3 but it still satisfies the rpg itch not fantastic but definitely not bad and if u dont already own it it only cost like 8 dollars 8 dollars for hundreds of gameplay hours what more is there to say still an icon and measure of all games to come after its fallout 3 the sequel new vegas will always be better haters gonna hate d i love playing games like fallout 4 i wish fallout 76 was like fallout 4 it’s no skyrim it’s more interactive than any other fallout game this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer is my

to my friends too this review was collected as part of a promotion high graphics and cool monitor high refresh rate as well this review was collected as part of a promotion i use my monitor for gaming i would say that i use my monitor between eight and nine hours each day this monitor has gorgeous vivid and beautiful colors that are so lifelike the display is very large and makes gaming so much more life like this review was collected as part of a promotion i used the monitor for gaming and it have excellent pixle frame quality 1010 this review was collected as part of a promotion me movies my son gaming i can enjoy my favorite shows and movies my son loves the way his game play comes out on the monitor all around great screen love it this review was collected as part of a promotion refresh rate works excellent \\nthe curve edge display is two perfection this review was collected as part of a promotion ive owned this monitor since launch the size is imagine and image quality is top knotch i havent felt the need to upgrade to new model motion and game looks great on this thing one major downside is the input it never display during bios bootup and when it comes to switching between input 1 and input 2 display port it is extremely buggy if you have one computer hooked up its fine but more than one this thing is a pain this review was collected as part of a promotion the curve samsung dual qled monitor is insane to look at while on full display of a movie or playing the latest video game \\nthe clarity is stunning and the viewing angle allows you to dive deep into the content you are looking at this review was collected as part of a promotion gaming and streaming the best monitor of all the only thing is the price but it is worth every dollar the monitor has a row of dead pixels and the screen flashes randomly i was hoping that i wouldnt be writing this kind of review that somehow samsung would have fixed the issues with this monitor still not the case and now they just closed the ticket that was open to repair it great this review was collected as part of a promotion i use this product for gaming and for movies and streaming and i reapply enjoy it i really love this controller but was honestly upset that a “new” one had the factory seals broken and taken out of the box all for display purposes i don’t see any reason for this as they had security locks that could have kept the controller from being stolen without physically taking it out of the box just because they say it’s new how do i know someone hadn’t used it i bought this a week or so ago and i couldn’t be happier loved these controllers when they were the latest and greatest with xbox original playing halo now feels like old times bought this because i loved the controllor on the original xbox this feels the same and yet better i bought this not to long ago just cause of the nostalgia and i needed another controller but i didn’t really expect me to be using it all the time but i am i haven’t used my normal controller ever since i got this it’s so comfortable in my big manly man hands even tho i don’t really have manly hands they’re just big like this controller but all that aside it’s amazing it works perfectly and i love how they added bumpers some say they’re cheaply made but i think they’re great this is my favorite version of the duke controller i have 2 black ones and thought this version was only limited to the people that developed it few weeks ago i saw it and forgot it released so i picked it up and didn’t regret it looks amazing and the grip and controls are just perfect reminds me so much of the old days i looooove this controller granted i might be biased as this is my favorite controller of all time this recreation is so great i especially love that the black and white buttons are still here and they are extra buttons for functions pros \\r\\n\\r\\nnostalgia \\r\\n\\r\\ncomfortable \\r\\n\\r\\nfunctionality \\r\\n\\r\\ndurability \\r\\n\\r\\nxbox logo lcd is awesome \\r\\n\\r\\ncons \\r\\n\\r\\nnot wireless \\r\\n\\r\\nnot for people with small hands \\r\\n\\r\\nleft and right bumpers might be a bit to far for some serious fps gamers \\r\\n\\r\\n \\r\\n\\r\\ni was using a razer wolverine ultimate same shaped and design as xbox one controller before this one and let me say just how good this controller feels in my hands in comparison the razer was giving me a really bad palm blister as a gamer knows we can play for several hours at a time and i feel i can play with this controller for hours with zero discomfort the left and right stick are very springy responsive and have a sense of resistance unlike most third party hardware producers that make thumb sticks feel weak they have a grip textured feel to them that feel amazing the way the dpad feels might not be for everyone but i love how squishy it feels when you hit the home button it plays the original xbox boot screen and i cant people enough about how freaking awesome it is i highly recommend this controller to anyone who is experiencing discomfort with their current controller or anyone who is looking for a good hit of nostalgia i am very happy with this purchase now all i need is a good carrying case for it i just received my green duke controller today my first game loaded up was halo combat anniversary ahhh the memories this is how this game was meant to be played if you have big hands i love it and highly recommend it this is a great game except for all the loading screens and bad fps at times ps4 i would recommend the game to anybody easy to lose track of time as you get sucked into this game so much to do and so many different ways to play it might be an older game but still one of the best in my opinion i have heard lots about this game but had never tried it it was all i had heard about and more i was very happy with it best game as always i got it first for the xbox and wanted it for the playstation really fun game keeps you on your toes and is full of surprises not mention cool equipment with the ability to upgrade and customize a fun game letdown by an averge main storyline but fixes some of the more annoying issues from previous games overall fun if you just want to wander and do whay you want i brought fallout 4 its a funny thing happen to mewell i took back a game on my ps4 i didnt like and saw fallout 4 at my local gamestop i figured new vegas was my favorite part and part 4 should be more upgraded version of the wasteland and i fell head over nikes for part 4i like the new upgrade character system im so glad they got rid of the closed caption text talk and now has real voice over for your character i give fallout 4 out of 5 stars 5 great game with all of the rpg elements that i love i just cant stand the archaeic animations and buggy attacks the vats system is different than the other fallouts having played this game for 2 days now im enjoying it immensely and wished fallout 76 werent in the situation it finds itself in bethesda couldve learned a lot from this title on how to use what made this game great on fallout 76 sad that for me it ends here unless the next fallout title shows promise this review was collected as part of a promotion these guys have been around for a long time i know in about six months if they will hold up for the flash light i use all the time i have stored them and used them much later and they worked  what can i say its a battery this review was collected as part of a promotion im so glad i picked this up we had a storm come through and my flashlight battery was dead so i put these in and 4 hours after leaving on the light it still was as strong as i opened up put in and my kids had gotten ahold and played with my light for awhile and

review was collected as part of a promotion energizer brand of batteries are my first choice they’re strong and dependable i recently went camping and i use them in my camping lights that i kept on through out each night they didn’t not drain my lights did not dim and they powered the lights for hours for the duration of my camping trip this review was collected as part of a promotion after a

gaming itsime im in the game i also use it for movies this review was collected as part of a promotion its a good monitor for gaming because you feel like you are in the game not the best for work because it doesnt serve as much benefits as gaming because with a normal monitor it would provide the same benefits this review was collected as part of a promotion quality for gaming indeed  always going for sure imagine the quality and curving size all much you need for  always good to have one of these bad boys if possible yes sir this review was collected as part of a promotion i love the overall look of the monitor the curve is a nice touch this review was collected as part of a promotion thrilled using the monitor a d outstanding quality this review was collected as part of a promotion i really like the view of the games i will definitely will tell others  about this monitor this review was collected as part of a promotion it works good for gaming because you fell like your in the game i dont really see a use for it at work because a flat would be the same for work but for gaming i would definitely use it this review was collected as part of a promotion best monitor ive ever used never buying a different one i love this i cant wait to have 6 someday for my ultimate pc setup this review was collected as part of a promotion i use it to game and it makes my eyes feel more real then real this review was collected as part of a promotion i love this product it makes gaming so much better this game will keep you occupied between the side quests crafting and general exploring there’s always something to be done this is my first actual fallout game experience although i did extensive research on the previous games and lore therof it was initially thrilling unique and held so much promise i loved exploring the immersion was enjoyable and building my character and my shelters felt well reasonable depending on the situations i stumbled into but then upon replaying a few times i realized it was extremely lacking in the rpg elements it claimed to boast the choices are limited and the plot steering devices by which i mean the game practically guides you along felt rather immersion breaking  and overall lazy i still personally like it its fun and interesting to a degree but it lacks a lot of core things that would really have been appreciated in a fallout game especially based in my research of the other games bought this last month with all the dlcs and its really fun the mod community on ps4 helped my game experience too very fun i absolutely love this game no downsides at all one of my all time favorites there are so many choices and so many outcomes and so much to do its never boring when you pick up this game again i am a fallout fan and when i comleted the last two entries i was hungry for more fallout 4 provides a familiar feel to its predecessors but it is all new locations tied to a compelling narrative i play on a standard ps4 and the graphics are wonderful the controls are smooth and sound is engaging\\r\\nthere are some minor issues with subtitles and the conversation camera angels seem arbitrary and strange but both can be turned off in settings i have not completed the game yet but i can still say it is just what fans of the series would expect with a low cost to entry for first time fallout players\\r\\nthis title is worth the time in a world where bethesda is the most hated game studio i can see how this would have helped earn that reputation it runs on a 20 year old engine it has loads of bugs and glitches that they dont fix the modding community has to release unofficial patches however when the game does work it works very well and i enjoy the gameplay the story is still kinda lacking though for ps4 the mods are much more limited but they do have a few good ones this game is fun out of the box however there are a large number of mods that make this game even more fun every single aspect of the game has modes from scenarios weapons armored building and homes and much more it is insane how many different quests and storylines are in this game really enjoyed the story and the game design is great finished the main storyline after a couple weeks and still want to keep playing after going a long time without a system i needed a game to reintroduce me to quality gaming and this was it gearbox removed lan feature without even a logical reason this game used to be amazing but now its garbage  will not change review until they add lan back no logical reason for removing it  and before anyone comments about playing online bad internet where i live and me and my friends used to play lan now it just sits uninstalled in my steam library bought this game awhile ago as a few of my friends have it and it looked like it would be a fun thing to play it is and i am glad i bought it very easy to play and as such very addictive bought this game when it first came out in 2012 lost it somehow and bought it again as a download\\r\\nbest yukyuk arcade style shootemup game ever stands the test of time  cant wait fo borderlands 3 this game is hard to describe and that is in the good way this game has it all procedurally generated loot awesome weapons more dlc than any other game i know hilarious characters like a certain cl4ptp unit and engaging story amazing open world size beat only by insert bethesda game here and so much customization this is only scratching the surface of borderlands 2s amazingnesseses i enjoy this game to many extents it appeals to my hardcore gamer side as well as my need for comedic effect in certain instances i love the multitude of references as well as the core gameplay mechanics it definitely lives up to the first ones reputation borderlands 1 trumps this game in almost every important aspect\\nthe guns in b1 look much better in b2 they all look really weird that you would think theyre all alien guns\\nin b1 you like the bad guysespecially general knoxx in b2 you are annoyed by them as they tell unfunny jokes and crude humor\\nthere are also some mean things that they do to old characters in b2 that i really hate i can not tell to you here you must google it\\nthe atmosphere is drenched with depression every step of the way that it sucks\\nalso they limited you to 27 items backpack yes a huge downgrade from b1\\ngearbox made some lame excuses about why it is that way but you can tell the writer does not even believe what the he was writing\\nits such a disappointment much more so because of so much work put into itgood environs mini bosses ruined at the core by flawed ideas physx physics engine really shines in this game people playing this game on xbox 360 or ps3 dont know what there missing dynamic particles are everywhere really helps to have a second video card just dedicated to running physx running 560 ti as main graphics card and 550ti as dedicated physx card this game is alot of fun to play there are thousands of guns that do all sorts of things from shooting fireballs to guns that explode when thrown the person who said this game is easy was most likely playing this on easy and then complained its way to easy sure its not the hardest game in the world but i wouldnt say its easy this game has alot to offer for this who are sick of generic fps games such as cod or battlefield only reason i didnt give it a ten is because i think the sound of the guns could have been much better but thats just my opinion this game is a terrific game it is so fun and addicting i play it all the time it is great for casual and hardcore gamers i seriously recommend this game to anyone who is considering about buying it hey guys just wanted to shed some light on pc version and console version as i own both if you have a pc that can run it then get it for pc youll love all the added physx stuff that goes along with it and having native 1080p support where as the console has 720p then upconverted and no aa applied the game for all 3 systems is solid and very fun more story this time around graphics are good but if your a pc gamer and play this game on console for example i originally purchased for xbox and edges of the game are really jagged and some of the graphics are meh on pc you can apply aa or fxaa and itll get rid of the jagged edges and the graphics are bumped up also the game supports physx so you got some extra goodies with the game if your card support it well thats just my 2 cents happy gaming this review was collected as part of a promotion i received the energizer max alkaline d batteries 2 pack in exchange for my review i received them just on time to put them in my granddaughters new bubble machine the batteries that we were using in it only worked a short timei installed the energizer batteries into the bubble machine and it worked for a very long time nonstoptoday we turned the machine on and the power is as strong as the day we first started using the energizer

gaming watching the news and i want too are if the galaxy can compete this review was collected as part of a promotion i had a party with my buddies to test this bad boy out we started off with call of duty which is my all time favorite we went straight to zombies after awhile and let me tell you this monitor blew us all away it was like we were literally there in action hearts racing we won the game thank you for you product i really like the fallout series and this one doesnt disappoint only problem i have is not enough points into my weight so i have to start dropping things but thats my fault the worst game ever super bad history and no exciting at all wasted money i just started playing a month ago and at this point i hate having to tend to settlements \\r\\n\\r\\ni enjoy the fact i could totally disregard tending to settlements\\r\\n\\r\\nits great to have settlements to tend to after the main body of the game has been completed\\r\\n\\r\\nconfusing right  \\r\\n\\r\\nglad there is more room for character enhancement  \\r\\n\\r\\nprevious fallout games are they only reason i purchased a ps4 on black friday like usual bethesda has added another solid installment into the video game field  anyone that has played any other bethesda titles will find themselves right at home with fallout 4  the same types of collecting bartering system and leveling up as say skyrim is at play here  great graphics solid gameplay albeit with a few bugs here and there and convincing story all add up to a really good gaming experience  looking forward to the next installment bought this as a  christmas gift for a loved one and have since been told they really like this game  he says its up there with cod games  quite the complimentfrom what i understand if you loved fallout 3  new vegas you will love f4 i have stopped playing yet love building my own settlements the game is execellentimo get the game of the year edition  so you can get more settlement building options   far harbor and nuka world this review is towards gamestop not the game itself seeing as i couldnt actually play the game due to them issuing an unplayable disc i know i should be grateful it came with a case at all but how battered it was really added insult to injury although i admit it was my own stupid fault for not testing the game before wrapping it up for christmas and missing out on my chance for a refund fallout 4 is just amazing if you like skyrim you’ll probably like this game as well this is the game that killed any more skyrim games for the future  i can see why nice and very fun to play 95 in my book only two locations i didnt like one has evil demonic photos on the wall and talks of witchcraft on the east of the map you fight through the area and last fight the enemy called death claw the other location is pinkertons gallery he is a serial killer character who uses body parts to make demonic satanic art he will ask you to look behind a painting for a reward if you rescue him its a knife that does extra  damage without these too evil areas i would rate the game 10 out of 10 it shows robots aliensghouls and humans as enemies you can be allies with all except aliens this is an amazing game already have beat it with two characters and still am find new things if you you thought it was too easy then you arent playing the missions at the correct level way better then borderlands 1 you gotta get it if you loved borderlands1 the story is amazing with a lot of funny parts spread around the game all i can say is amazing cant stop playing the game has consumed my life the moment i bought it i couldnt get off first of all why are you reading this you should have bought this game ages ago its borderlands 2 this game is the best coop experience you can buy so much fun to play with your friends the dialog is the funniest stuff ive ever heard and this games has 87 bazillion guns they even got an award for most guns in a video game yeah a freaking award now go to gamestop right now and throw all your money at the register and buy this game stop reading this already and goooooooooo its a fun game but i didnt feel like it was hard at all i laugh at people that play this game go play a real game that actually takes skill this review was collected as part of a promotion i really enjoyed getting these batteries they are a reliable product i always buy this brand they last along time and are very dependable i use them in my flashlight and i can always count on my flashlight to be working when i need it this review was collected as part of a promotion excellent battery that has been working well with everyday use for about 2 weeks  no sign of them running out of juice  the 10 year shelf life is a real bonus if you stock up on batteries like i do

as part of a promotion i use this monitor for both gaming and work and it excels at both for work the extra screen real estate is excellent everything on the screen is sharp and looks crisp for gaming the high refresh rate makes games feel super smooth and they of course look great also i highly recommend this to anyone my only reason for 4 stars instead of 5 stars is i think there should be a way to only use the middle portion of the screen not ultrawide for those things that are not ready to run in ultrawide mode this can be done by using pip mode but it just does not work in the center of the display that is my only complaint otherwise an excellent product this review was collected as part of a promotion i enjoy the product for gamingstreaming and watching movies this review was

four nights alone when i didnt feel like going out and with my kid and my dogs it would be a great addition to my house this review was collected as part of a promotion i would welcome samsung to anyone its very protecting i love the app recently bought this game love it the whole fallout series is amazing love creating settlements and just exploring the wasteland i have played the previous in the series and enjoyed them the follows in a great tradition bought it less than a month ago enjoying it but software has alot o glitches happened 5 times so far i bought this game a few weeks ago and my only regret is i dont have as much time to play it as i want the detail and action are perfectly balanced and the stories are great even when short have a friend thats been playing this for awhile decided to give it a try and if i liked it  maybe try fallout 76 i bought this game for the amazing content and storyline i loved it glad there is a new one now i gotta give this game 5 stars not only for the storylinebut allowing to add mods as well mind you i didnt even realize we could add mods till my character was a hard earned lvl 247 i bought this when it first came out and played through it traded it in for credits and hadnt thought about it in a while with the new fallout 76 coming out i wanted to get back into that world this game is great you could play through it several different times each with a different path i had bought this when it was new but i was playing 2 other games at the same time  i didnt give it justice  now i bought it about 3 weeks ago and 8 love it  there are so many things to do in this game i love the openness of the world and just running around to find all the hidden areas that aren’t part of a quest the story pulls you in and i feel as if i’m making a difference also like the radio this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries seemed to do as well as other energizer batteries that i have used while i cant tell you how they were will stay working i have not had an issue with them so far they are working great this review was collected as part of a promotion batteries are good energizer has been a trusted name for batteries for years and these are no different dont waste your money on off brands you wont get the same amount of power out of your batteries and will buy twice as many this review was collected as part of a promotion i am a huge fan of energizer batteries these batteries are great quality and long lasting we typically use quite a bit of batteries for the kids toys luckily we havent had to change them even with a ton of use this review was collected as part of a promotion i have a flashlight that stopped working but works again with the energizer max alkaline d batteries  the light is not real strong though and it could be because the light bulb is weak  it is also too early to tell how long these batteries last  but overall i am glad the flashlight works again this review was collected as part of a promotion i was a bit skeptical in trying these batteries because i have tried long lasting batteries before and they didn’t seem to last much longer than regular batteries i have tried  i was pleasantly surprised with these batteries after i have been using them in my electric garbage can lid for over a month and they are still going other batteries i have put in there seem to maybe make it about a month at best  i will see how long these end up going but i think based on what i have seen so far i will be purchasing more in the future this review was collected as part of a promotion the energizer is really a good value  last longer than other batteries and since it is the d it is in lamps we use for emergencies and our large flashlights   have already purchased more to have on hand this review was collected as part of a promotion these d energizer batteries are the best they hold the longest surge to keep power i use these batteries for my mechanical trash can and it works very well and for quite a long time energizer batteries are purchased in my home for everything that needs a battery and i am always satisfied with the results energizer should be the leader in energy and boosting it bc their product lasts the longest from my perspective anyway i would recommend all energizer batteries and products to my family and friends for use in their homes cars andor offices that they work out of i received these batteries 3 weeks ago to try out as a tester and like always i am thoroughly impressed by the power and how long the energy lasts i give the product a 2 thumbs up and i would definitely recommend them to more than family  coworkers and friends deserve to have these very essential batteries in their homes as much as i do this review was collected as part of a promotion received these and put them straight into our camping lantern  they work great and the lantern lit up well  we have been using it regularly outdoors on our patio and it is working well and hasnt lost any brightness  these are quality batteries with a good long life this review was collected as part of a promotion i received 2 energized max alkaline d batteries just in time because i bought a toy and didnt read that the batteries was not included to my surprise we have been using the toy with the batteries for over a week and the batteries still perform like

i use these energizer batteries for my portable fanlight and i must say i am beyond impressed how long these batteries are holding up i use my fan anywhere for 6 to 8 hours five times a week at work and this routine has been going on for almost 3 weeks talk about long lasting i have always been a fan of the energizer brand i am glad i gave these energizer max d cell batteries a try because i am

competition cs go looks to amazing really ehnaces color detail thank your samsung for this beast of a mointer this review was collected as part of a promotion that was the best monitor ever to play video games for multitasking activities this review was collected as part of a promotion it will be used for gaming work and school  netflix internet everything amazing monitor this review was collected as part of a promotion i got this for gaming and its pretty awesome the wide curved screen is like having 3 monitors in one this review was collected as part of a promotion gaming streeming  thats all and shoping and movies this review was collected as part of a promotion made my gaming experience more enjoyable looking forward to buy another soon this review was collected as part of a promotion i bought this monitor for flight and racing simulation it has definitely enhanced the experiences for both simulators \\n\\nin racing i can now see further into corners without having to change the viewpoint as far as emersion goes its nice to be able to see the drivers side and rear view mirrors at the same time depending on the vehicle sometimes you can see both side mirrors which feels nice to me\\n\\nits use for flight simulation is even more pronounced situation awareness doubles with half the movements immediately taxiing and landing become easier because of the side references its also easier to track gauges during these operations because of less viewpoint changes of course looking out of the window on vfr flights is stunning\\n\\nit is also a great monitor for having multiple pages open i can have 4 pages of notes open simultaneously with no problem i did have to adjust the font size for this type of operation but once adjusted everything is great\\n\\nheres why the monitor looses a star when you are looking around changing the viewpoint in flight simulation the outer quarters to thirds of screen will begin to distort and elongate its usually not that bad but i thought it is worth mentioning really 412 or 434 stars is more accurate for this monitor this review was collected as part of a promotion i use for gaming is excelent to wach movies is perfect this review was collected as part of a promotion for games and movies i love it and its the best i would not even think of having another brand or monitor this review was collected as part of a promotion i use my monitor mainly for video games and a little streaming i love the picture quality i will never get another brand of monitor againhow satisfied i am typing this review happy to play it makes me look forward to the new one loving it so far 1st time playing any of the fallout series loving it a lot every time i start a new play through of the game i discover something new  which leads me to never want to put down the controller the game itself is very in depth on detail and you can easily get lost for hours playing this i started playing fallout 4 months ago when my brother had it for box xbox i instantly got hooked and loved the game when i started i recently bought it for mine and my sisters ps4 my sister now loves the game and we all love it i am happy i bought it and haven’t stopped playing since i got it are you tired of games that are fun are you sick games that are filled with action if you are looking for a game where you just walk around searching for garbage then this is the game for you it be great the mods good side stores evering is so good this is an awesome game lots of action but not mindless violence either the story line is perfect with lots of missions that require some thinking play this game i have had fallout 4 almost as long as its been out it is the one game i constantly play because of the modable feature very much like skyrim but with guns and ability to build your home has its bugs and glitches like every game good game play and story mods do bug and glitch more than youd like honestly this bundle to date is still one of if not the best bundle kingsisle has ever come out with\\r\\n\\r\\nthe house is beautiful the gear is beautiful everything is absolutely amazing with this bundle\\r\\ni bought this cause i figured i would use basically everything in the bundle and get my moneys worth i have to say i for sure got my moneys worth\\r\\nthe only thing i do not like is that you cannot dye the mount to match the gear and the pet is a racoon which is okay \\r\\n\\r\\nbut everything else is incredible and i do not regret getting this bundle at all nice pack its not just a house but a community of homes kids have lots of rooms to decorate cool looking convertible car amazing bundle gear is nothing crazy but the looks and aesthetic of the gear and house are amazing beautifully detailed artwork serene atmosphere i especially like the gong that sounds when you first arrive a great addition to the housing items offered in wizard101 gear is absolutely beautiful i plan on using the robe for a stitch loving it along with the fantastic fairytale bundle this is the best house if you’re looking for a mooshu themed player home the graphics have been updated to match the wizard city remaster so graphically this house looks superb the home is quite large as it is both floating and moving high above the sky the home also provides multiple floors through hidden doors an arena and plenty of outdoor space stats wise the gear is ok but you’re far better off using ingame gear such as waterworks and darkmoor gear appearance wise however the gear is quite nice well detailed and very unique but i’d definitely say the wand is the nicest piece of the gear on appearance alone as for the pet and mount the pet is life school so that may be worthwhile for life mains but other than that it’s cute while also being a bit larger than i expected the mount is also quite nice it’s only 40 speed and on the smaller side of the mounts so it only holds one person but very smooth animations and while it may not be as wide as other mounts it does have a bit of height to it overall it’s a very nice bundle and if you’re at all interested in mooshu themed gear and home then this bundle is worth it the only reason i gave it 4 stars instead of 5 is because stat wise this bundle isn’t the greatest but i feel most people won’t be buying it because of the stats it’ll be for the home and appearance of gear super cool house very good stats on the equipment highly recommended everything in this bundle helps you so much in the game to further advance yourself i love the mount and the full gear but what amazes me the most is the house the house is so beautiful this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer  max batteries last a really long time  they are a great battery

impressed with the quality of performance of energizer max alkaline d batteries i used it for my electronic keyboard and have been using it for a long time changing batteries can be annoying but with this one you dont have to worry about it excellent build and performance this battery fits your need i definitely recommend it over any other brand this review was collected as part of a promotion its always a pain running out of batteries especially the ones that drain so fast these last a long time very happy with it i do prefer the rechargeable ones though wish they made them in this size im all about sustainability right now this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries were used in a toy that is used often i got them months ago and they are still going strong the package comes easy to open and the brand has a great reputation easy to install and they look pretty cool this review was collected as part of a promotion its hard to write a review on batteries that arent used a lot  i got these batteries for a flashlight  we dont use the flashlight very often but so far these batteries are working great as i expected and the light is nice and bright this review was collected as part of a promotion i use my monitor for gaming and video production and although it cost me a pretty penny im actually considering buying another one hands down the best computer monitor ive ever owned this review was collected as part of a promotion over all great features the screen is alsome cant wait try it this review was collected as part of a promotion i use my monitor for gaming watching movies and work this review was collected as part of a promotion ive always been a fan of ultra wide monitors and the samsung oddsey g9 is certainly the king of monitors  its bright has great colors and design wise its awesome  the ability to split the monitor in half and using two separate inputs on each side of the monitor is a perk that most dont have  its a bit quirky at times but once you learn how to resolve it typically unplugging the second input from thr device  id say the trade off of it being finicky at times makes the feature well worth it and im sure itll get better with time  whether youre gaming or doing productive tasks this is an excellent monitor this review was collected as part of a promotion noticed when i was trying to go through thinking about this monitor i tried it at a friends place first which has had several issues with the 95 model the 97 model seems to be a better unit but definitely seems to retain some of the issues over time this review was collected as part of a promotion i use it for gaming watching videos and streaming live events this review was collected as part of a promotion i use mine for my computor and it is by far the cleanest most crisp clear screen ive ever seen this review was collected as part of a promotion my eyes were on the original odyssey g9 for a while i saw it had a lot of issues at its launch so i decided to wait for samsung to fix all the issues the neo g9 came out and wanted to give it a try honestly i know it costs a lot but it really does help with productivity which in my eyes is priceless would buy another one if i could this review was collected as part of a promotion fast efficient clearview\\nmy son enjoyed playing on thus console this review was collected as part of a promotion the samsung crg9 is a good monitor for most uses it delivers a great gaming experience as it has excellent low input lag and impressive motion handling its large highresolution screen is excellent for office use or media creation allowing you to have multiple windows opened sidebyside i preordered this for ps4 in 2015 and was not disappointed it had a great story awesome twists a cool settlement building setup and great voice acting i highly recommend this if you’re excited for fallout 76 so as to train your building skills thanks bethesda good game overall which is why it still gets 4 stars didnt stack up to 3 or new vegas plus sony throttled the mods like a bunch of commission but at least it has mods at all i bought it a couple days ago and it’s great it’s so worth buying i bought this in 2015 and i’ve played through the story 4 times i’m on my 5th time and i’m still not bored it’s so cheap these days it’s essential to have this in your collection so far so good a friend referred me to this game and its as good as he says it was for my first time playing any of the fallout games it was pretty fun beyond my exceptions lots of action and adventure plenty of other things to do beside the story missions game was great with graphics and screen resolution the fallout series is one that takes you into a world of a postnuclear apocolypse where you fught to stay alive in an unfprgiving world every choice you make determines do many factors in the game you can be good or evil you can have companions that you can romance each with their own well written tragic backstorymy personal favorite being hancock and nick valentinein fallout 4 you are pre war and you fight to find your missing son stole from you while you were unable to do anything bought this at the kirby dr location and the manager was very helpful on how to play his name was adam or josh he had long hair he is awesome and made this purchase awesome i got this game like 3 weeks ago and it is the best game ever soft shirts a bit over priced but what can ya say its gamestop great quality shirt runs long but i like that in shirts shirt sizes run small so go a little bigger than what you usually wear love it otherwise shirt is grey not black but i like it i got it several sizes too big so i can sleep in it its very comfy i’ve been notified that my package was “delivered” \\r\\nhowever i deem that statement to be fake news or an alternative fact at best \\r\\nwhen will the package actually arrive its a very nice shirt to wear i thoroughly enjoy wearing it shirt fits great but is on a much lighter gray shirt than it appears in the product image nice shirt my fiance and brothers liked it wrong color i dont know who makes these shirts but there all super comfy i thought this would be the

like it but came back to it and then loved it after spending countless hours playing fallout 3 this game was very boring to me this game is an excellent addition to the fallout series i loved 3 and

game after friends recommended it i love it can’t wait to get fallout 76 this game does not quite stand up to 3 or nv but it is a great game in its own respect i purchased this game a month ago and the features of the game are outstanding plays as good as fallout 3 or new vegas map  readout could be more defined i bought fallout 4 about 3 weeks ago and i think its a terrific game its just like fallout 3 but much more detailed the game plays great and is not plagued by the glitches that fallout 3 had bonus there is always something to do in this game and plenty of bad guys to kill viciously about this game a while ago didnt finish the storyline love the storyline in the difficulty of the length of the game as well and the exploration im still playing it and i already want to start a new game so many ways to enjoy this game this review was collected as part of a promotion i got these batteries and just happened to have them handy i was doing something that required a flashlight and my

they keep going and going and going and  \\r\\ni definitely recommend energizer max batteries this review was collected as part of a promotion so my fiancé is notorious for buying things before we need them i would buy batteries when the other batteries died so to have these when i needed them was great i was impressed that the date on them was almost ten years i put them in my flashlight and i should be good to go for a few years with normal use we have several flashlights and will replace with the energizer max when the time comes this review was collected as part of a promotion i got

added mercury or cadmium this review was collected as part of a promotion i am someone who really gets annoyed when i constantly have to replace the batteries in my stuff such as my led candles clocks and tv remotes so i decided to try these batteries and i am so glad that i did because they truly do last a long time i wanted to compare them with my other ones so i put a different battery in each of my candles at the same time i am honestly shocked that i have now had to replace my candle twice with the other battery but this one is still going strong i would definitely recommend these

youll love it if its your first time welcome to jurassic park tinu ni nu nu tinu ni nu nu tinunu nu ni although i have only been playing the game for about two weeks but i enjoy the game and it’s story i bought this game hearing that this was an amazing open world game and it was yeah im 60years old and watched my grandson of age 6 play on his tablet we loved taking turns i wanted to be able to play my own as a player 2 went to look for this game as it was a 2 player up to a 4 player gam estop made it easy by looking and finding is wasnt in their store ordered and it in came and in time for christmas we play and i able able to enjoy this game angry birds star wars with ease we bought this game to play with our adult children it was easy to learn and fun for all to play four player games are getting to be so rare now days and this was perfect this game should have been ended a long time ago on the mobile devices of course but yet they decide to keep it alive this game should not be bought for it is just a higher price than the mobile device prices a full review of this game is not needed because this game fails to deliver any real and new content other than the new levels they made there is no new content this game sucks it is angry birds on the xbox it does not work plus angry birds is outdated and should be put to rest it you played angry birds you will like this game it is for everyone to play becasue it is a casual game this review was collected as part of a promotion i have a maglite that i carry in my jeep i always buy energizer batteries\\r\\nthey last along time i dont use my flash light all the time but when i do need it i can count on the battery to work\\r\\nive tried other batteries when i was camping and they didnt seem to last as long this review was collected as part of a promotion if youre like me youve always thought batteries are batteries and paid no mind to brandwrongand ive found out the hard way ive had batteries that didnt fit securely because of a smaller than standard size some that didnt last more than a few days in a low drain device and some that leaked into the device after just a few months\\r\\nwell let me tell yathese energizer max d guys are exactly what i prefer in my name brand flickering flameless candles they fit snugly and dont bend the spring and by far outlast competitors on average i get about a month of 12hr daily use from one set surprisingly these candles are actually a higher drain because of their constantly moving flame so frequently buying unbranded batteries ended up more expensive than buying energizer having a longer shelf life also means i can stock up when theyre on sale and not worry about them being dead upon opening no worries with the energizer brand just buy the best and be done  this review was collected as part of a promotion what can i say its energizer its what gas powered my world since i was a kid in the 70s and 80s as a grown adult i need to budget more and tried to use low end batteries from the local dollar type store  but the problem is you end up buying more of those to do the same job as 2 energizer and it is not longer cost effective  for the money and longevity its energizer all the way for me this review was collected as part of a promotion this product does exactly what it is supposed to do it is a very trustworthy battery that i can rely on for important things now that i’ve had a baby i use a lot more batteries than i used to and i know these are safe and will work for a long time this review was collected as part of a promotion we have

others we mostly use them for toys of course then we have no need to change them for quite sometime no batteries last as long as an energizer battery to me the most important thing is that a battery

sound along with the movement is perfect i bought this 2 days ago and never worked i want my money back i played this with my best friend and it is so awesome please buy its worth it great graphics and gameplay storyline is lacking great to play i think that people will like it all this fallout games game play is fantasticthe power armor feels amazing and rewarding the weapons are great with the mods that make your weapons more powerful and the aiming mechanic is much improved the only bad weapons are the pipe ones the sights are horrible on them \\r\\nthe settlement system is cool but becomes annoying with how many there are because you are expected to basically build on all of them to protect people\\r\\nthe only thing holding this game back is the story it is so boring overall with the exception of a few questsit seems like they poured most of their effort into game play versus developing the story more most missions consist of retrieving items and killing enemies at least with fallout 3 and new vegas if they had those kind of missions they werent so boring best game purchase ever i have spent hundreds of hours playing this game since it came out very fun game if youre into the fallout series or bethesda this game is pretty addictive typical for any fallout or elder scrolls game really i really enjoy the settlement building in this game and also enjoyed the storyline this is my current game obsession i have had it for 9 months and keep returning to it it has building mode for when i dont feel combative  tons of customization options on gear and weapons interesting quest lines engaging combat and opponents and a variety of companions to choose from when adventuring  i love this game it is a very fun game until halfway through the main story it just gets stale 14 of the game is a quest telling you to go grab an item and bring it back this is a game for casual gamers or people who have never played a fallout game i really enjoy games made by bethesda i like the open world game play after about 3 months one chairs leg broke my son is not that heavy table legs are loose no mater how much they are tighteneddisappointed because it’s cute just what i needed for my little grandson  perfect size and nice clean look  chairs are sturdy never tipped over  this is my second purchase granddaughter is still enjoying her table set in use for 3 years  it has held up very well with daily use  a great selection at a reasonable price this is my second time to buy this chair set the best i’ve been looking for a table set for my 2 year old son to do activities such as reading coloring etc and i found this one  i love it because of its good quality highly recommend we purchased this table and chair set for our granddaughter 4 12 years ago and it has been fantastic  its sturdy and stylish  so perfect in fact that weve now bought a second set for our grandson easy to clean very stable never fall dawn easy to essamble scratches resistant after 2 years in use still looks like new and we were using it every day recommend from the bottom of my heart and price for this super high quality is very cheap great little table great quality  very attractiveperfect for my 15  3 year old need to have a better wrench then comes in packet  would take a lot longer to put together without having a socket set weve played hard on this table for several months now my kids love it and it looks great in our playroom the chairs are quite sturdy and havent tipped over when my 2 year old has done crazy things on them the set has been a great addition for our two young boys we did have an issue with the top getting chipped by one of the boys who was slamming a truck against the edgetop notch customer service i recently purchased this set for my sons room and i love it the chairs are strong and wide enough that im not worried about breaking them if i sit down i looked at a lot of sets and settled on this one mostly because i liked the way it looked and i love all of our other kidkraft products i was very pleased to find the quality matched the design this review was collected as part of a promotion honestly you cant go wrong with energizer works in my heavy duty flashlight perfectly very reasonably priced also very powerful  long lasting quality is always top notch packaged very well too highly recommended this review was collected as part of a promotion we have a huge need for batteries in our house between a toddler and baby and these don’t disappoint we are using them in our baby’s swing and use the swing for hours a day and they’ve been working great this review was collected as part of a promotion i absolutely love the energizer max alkaline d2 batteries because they have longlasting power for my flashlight which is very essential i can stock up on these batteries because they have a 10year shelf life which is extremely important the name of the battery says it all energizer max this review was collected as part of a promotion energizer batteries are the best they definitely last longer than any other brand that i have tried energizer is the best and is the only brand of batteries that i use it is definitely true that they keep running and running this review was collected as part of a promotion i always buy energizer max any time my family needs batteriesi am happy to buy these because it means less buying for methey last a really long time and that means saving money energizer batteries gives my flashlights a bright shine this review was collected as part of a promotion i got these batteries to use for my flashlight it is a high powered so it goes through batteries pretty quick i was very impresssed with the use i am getting out of these batteries they have outlasted all of the previous ones and are a stronger use my beam is brighter and reaches further than before i am going to keep using these batteries for my tools and equipmemt that need batteries that are dependable this review was collected as part of a promotion ive been using these on my daughters swing and theyve worked great its always good for me to have d batteries laying around the house i also have a heavy duty flashlight that these work great with this review was collected as part of a promotion great batteries as always from energizer i used these d batteries in my childs toy and the longevity of use is so much better than any of the other brands that ive tried \\r\\n\\r\\npackaging is simple easy to understand the positive and negative are clearly labelled so it is hard to put these in wrong as long as you look at the device youre using and ensure youre putting the battery in the right way \\r\\n\\r\\ni didnt notice any kind of venting on the batteries around the top cap or around the bottom would definitely buy again this review was collected as part of a promotion my husband had been using cheap batteries in his flashlight for a long time and was frustrated that they never lasted long enough we tried the energizer max d2 batteries and have not has any problems the flashlight doesnt flicker and the light is nice and strong this review was collected as part of a promotion these batteries are definitely worth it i’ve made the mistake of buying generic or offbrand batteries for price sake but i feel like they essentially end up costing you more money time and effort in the long run instead of just buying the real deal these guys up front these will be my goto from now on only one side of the headphones work when in chat horrible love my set and my child loves his but my kid could break a pet rock so we did have to use the warranty for his headphones  pretty nice quality for the price in my opinion nice starter headphones good sound quality easy to mute doesnt hurt my ears barely bothers when i wear my gaming glasses either my ears hurt after an hour of using it  even with low volume ive had this game for a couple of months and i love that you can never get bored there are countless things to do and you can replay it to get different endings resident evil and fallout are incredible and awesome they both have great gameplay and stories i strongly recommend them ive read a lot these reviews i am getting frustrated with people bashing a game this large with how it looks also it funny people that write bad reviews love fallout new vegas that is the worst one my god you can create a city in fallout 4 its amazing there is actually no limit to what you can do unlike most games every building is explorable along with a huge maps and items that keep you questingexploring to recieve them it is a good game for everyone to play the guns are awesome and they do a lot of damage and the animals are big and cool and there is a death claw each is a every every big monster there is medal suits kind of like iron man this has to be the best of the fallout series ive played new vegas and 3 and those were good but this game was fantastic this game is the worst game overall i will never recommend it to anyone its a terrible game and it should have never ever ever ever ever been made story not as good as fallout 3 and new vegas but gameplay is amazing variety of weapons and many quest and good features ive played fallout 4 a lot ive spent 170 hours playing it on steam and another 50 or so hours on ps4 the game is a shooterrpg combo much like its predecessors fallout 3 and fallout new vegas there are changes that have been made to this installment though some of them help it really shine but some of them feel like the game may be abandoning its core audience as opposed to the previous games in the series this game is very action oriented you will find yourself using the new sprint function a lot and in lots of high energy shootouts i enjoyed the adrenaline rushes from these segments but i can see why hardcore fallout fans could see this as a negative there have been many changes to the stats of the game skill are completely gone replaced by perks that you unlock as you level up this system was implemented to avoid being perfect at everything i think but it doesnt really work because a lot of perks that improve your skills dont have very high requirements in their respective special what represents attributes that would be in other rpgs a settlement system has also been implemented although not very well in my opinion lots of your custom homes will probably end up looking like stacked squares or maybe i just suck at the home building either way i didnt get much out of it the storyline is alright having a branching story that involves 4 factions trying to obtain control over the commonwealth the area in which fallout 4 takes place and to avoid spoilers all ill say is that there are really only 2 factions with fully developed stories and really 2 distinct endings although the monologue is the same with every ending which is very disappointing the dialogue system has been simplified tossing a lot of flavor text which wasnt really a bother or a credit to me it was kinda just there if youre looking for a fun rpgshooter that leans more on the shooter side to sink a lot of time into fallout 4 is the game for you if you want to play fallout 3new vegas in a new engine you might just wanna skip this one oh and as typical of bethesda lots of bugs and crashes this game is beyond what i expected the gameplay was solid the music was perfect and the story was well crafted a true successer to fallout 3 this review was collected as part of a promotion first these came in a very easy to open package second and most important they work d batteries are great for things like heavy duty flashlights or in our case once we had kids we started chewing through batteries in all their toys obviously with energizer you can trust that theyll last and stay safe this review was collected as part of a promotion when i think of batteries i think energizer max they last so long and really improve the function of whatever you are putting them in i use energizer max exclusively and have for years energizer is a trusted family brand and always exceeds my expectations this review was collected as part of a promotion my go to batteries are energizer max and these d batteries are no different bought them as needed for pump to blow up an air mattress as we didnt have any in the house

promotion i really  like the batteries  they last a long time i let all my family  and friends  know about the batteries  i got  from tryit i will recommend these batteries  to everyone  i cant wait

suggesting and getting this review was collected as part of a promotion my son is in school  he injoy using this monitor working school homework and playing roblox the neo g9 is simply outstanding hdr is excellent with an oledlike quality it does take some time to set up this monitor correctly many of the negative reviews here are from folks who dont have a clue how to do that or for older generations of the odyssey g9 this review is for the neo g9 released in 2021\\n\\nim continually blown away by the image quality and immersion every time i boot up from a three 27 monitors 1080p setup to this single qhd 49 monitor takes my gaming to a whole new level\\n\\ni highly recommend the neo g9 to anyone serious about image quality and gaming response take the time to set it up correctly and

has picture perfect quality i loved the price and the voice control hands free always work for me i would recommend this product by samsung a very exciting experience this review was collected as part of a promotion i used my screen to watch 4k movies on netflix  etc and play some very super intense graphic games its a very nice screen  high quality love the viewing experience on it this is an enjoyable game with multiple endings i would recommend getting the dlc also nuka world dlc will give you the best weapons in my opinion i bought fallout 4 when it first came out and i cannot tell you the awesmness of this game i have been following the fallout series since the 1990s and since bethesda took over the franchisee it has been nothing but spectacular the gameplay graphics and audio score are wonderful this is a game where you can truly immerse yourself in if you liked skyrim you will love fallout it has much of the same game play mechanics and you will be able to explore a large and vast world i would definitely recommend fallout 4 to any serious gamer do not buy ps4 version sony has blocked a major feature buy only xbox or pc versions as these have full game i have played this game everyday since it first came out everyday its been the best one ever to occupy my time the game play is never endingthe graphics are great the interactions are just outta this world for me me and a buddy of mine online have been playing together the whole game and been challenging each other the whole way its made the game even better we were going for our twentieth bobble head at the same time merely minutes apart racing towards our winning moment to each others win against one another for different bobble heads in different places of course but each of us knew where each others bobbles heads where lol well he found his and i missed my door and got myself lost and he beat me ny eight minutes finding his first dang itit stunk that he beat me to the kast bobble head but i got my platinum trophy a month before he did so i got my revenge but thats the kind of fun you and your mates can have with fall out 4 as well this game is like one of those people that you meet and at first you think theyre really cool but the more you get to know them the less and less you like them gaming is an art and some consider it a sport the game fallout 4 was intense challenging and hard to conquer the vocabulary alone that is asked before you begin the game is high level i thought the game kept me on my toes and forced me to think during each battle the journey that is taken with the exploration was exciting creating the characters prior to the game play was also something i genuinely enjoyed doing the possibility of surviving the ride is however not promise to any gamer when playing red i hated this game i loved fallout 3 new vegas was pretty good but this game meh it is just basically fallout 3 all over again just a slightly different story with worse features the settlement feature was the worst addition it is basically a crude farmville with a terrible interfacei played for a few hours but decided it would be in my best interest to return it hardcore fallout fans would love it i just did not to all the people looking for a good gaming experience this is for you good feel for the whole world just overall great to play ive been waiting for a new fallout since 3 and new vegas so when i heard bethesda announce a new installment i was very excited unfortunately after playing the game for a while that excitement turned to disappointment they stripped a lot of mechanics from the game including stats to level your character also npcs have about 3 lines of dialogue and are very shallow the dialogue wheel was pointless and every option had the same result the settlement builder seemed like a good idea but wasnt thought out very well it felt like it was just tacked on as a afterthought overall thats how a lot of the game felt like it wasnt thought out and was half assed it definitely tried to appeal more to casual shooter fans which didnt make sense since that alienates your own audience their is very little crossover between fallout and call of duty in terms of fanbase so the shift in direction doesnt really make sense i have fallout 4 for my xbox one i had bought fallout 4 for ps4 because i had gotten it for my gamer friend who has a ps4 and i was telling him about it and i figured it would be better just to get it for him and let him try it out to see what i was talking about he says that he loves fallout 4 if he hadnt i had just bought the uncharted 4 ps4 bundle and i would have gladly taken back fallout 4 back and i could have played it on xbox one and ps4 anyways i am glad that my gamer friend enjoys it mass effect 3 was one of the best games ive played in a while recently i bought the trilogy for my pc beforehand having been played on my console i believe that the best aspect of this game including its trilogy is its story the mass effect series does a profound job at taking hold of your emotions youre going to get attached to these characters meaning youll feel triumphant when they fight by your side youll be amused when they socialize with you and most of all youll be sad when they die although youre going to have more of an emotional connection with your character shepard heshe is the embodiment of yourself whether you abide by whats right or whats wrong sure a lot of people create their character to be the hero or villain they can never strive to be but if youre like me then youll be emotionally connected in defining shepard in such ways as picking options that coincide with what you feel or even what youd do in a similar situation anyway the voice acting is on par characters like liara and garrus portray a believable entity while jennifer hale as femshep is astounding in terms of the graphics youll shutter in fear at the detail and height of the towering reaper flagships and depending on your modeling skills admire the beautyhandsomeness of your shepard including other vital characters gameplay is great as usual with a wide assortment of weapons to combat the reaper and cerberus hordes as well as the various abilities that further defy your foes lastly as for the ending many say that it was awful but with the extended cut its at least acceptable by rpg standards what matters though is the journey not the destination in mass effect this game was one of the best i have played excellent story great interactivity and much more personally i had no problem with the ending and dont understand the haters of this whole game just because of the ending definitely worth it yes i said its a great game i even went out and bought mass effect 1  2 so i could play the entire series its well worth the purchase and even with the original ending i actually had preorder the game but just got tired of all the negativity the game has gotten up to now that i decided to write a review graphics sound gameplay all great giving this game anything below an 8 just because you didnt like the ending really destroys the hard work these people put into it well thats my thoughts about the game movement suckes story sucks fighting was ok at best\\njust overall game play seemed like i was playing a 2002 game wasnt polished at all pass on this wasted money this is one of the best games i have ever played it has the best story line and only one bad side to it the bad side is that the ending sucks but i would recommend this game to every body who loves any mass effect this is easily biowares most casualfriendly streamlined game the rpg elements are very minimal and the highoctane action is pretty much driving the whole story if you enjoy actionadventure games that simply tour different exotic setpieces then this game is well worth 3040 if you like quasistrategic action shooters you might have a great time with this but as an rpg and as the critical installment in a series the game falls quite flat\\n\\nthere were also quite a few graphical and sound glitches at launch as well as gameplay hiccups that hurt the multiplayer experience beyond that the action button technique that bioware insists on using is quite cumbersome in this game the action button has about 5 or 6 different functions which leads to a lot of gameplay problems me3 is far from perfect but in the right state of mind it can certainly be a heck of a good time this game was incredible all the way through despite a glitch here and there that would result in a reload if you ask anyone what they would rate this game before the end i guarantee you would not get less than a 9 but people are very sore about the end of the gamewill try not to spoil anythingthis game had a very amazing ending i wanted to shed a tear it was so amazing and it came to a conclusion that has a cinematic ending that anyone would hope for if they were watching a film its just that because it is a well loved game nobody likes it the multiplayer sucks however i am not going to lie about that and you have to play it to get a decent ending out of the game but if i may say so this is the best game i have ever played and i would recommend it to anyone and everyone if you love mass effect you will hate this game if you carried your many in my case dozens of shepards through the first two games please dont load them up into this dreamcrusher that they call mass effect 3 everything that made the first two games amazing is lacking the plot has more holes that a metal seive most character development is poor and many wellloved characters are simply not there the ending is the worst thing i have ever experieced in my life that is no exaggeration and do not take that lightly not really sure where to startthere were just too many issues with this game to give it a good review the entire game felt rushed from character development to the levels the side missions were rather boring and were mostly find and retrieve missions the ending made no logical sense and the decisions you made in this game meant very little in the end i liked the previous two mass effect games much better not sure what happened with this one this game is amazing and if your a true mass effect fan and know how the games play you know that there is much more to the game than just running thru the game and beating it mass effect is one of the best gaming franchises ever made and yes the ending was a bit of a disappointment but if your a true die hard me fan than this game is amazing and the ending shouldnt ruin the entire game for you i went through and did all the side missions and played the multiplayer and got my effective military strength and galatic readyness as high as they could go and the ending was not as horrible as everyone is saying if you go through and play it like a true me fan you will love this game and when bioware releases the new ending sometime this summer it will make the game even better this review was collected as part of a promotion we used this product to consolidate and make my sons craft supplies more accessible pleased to report that now hes drawing

review was collected as part of a promotion we bought this monitor originally for my wife to use for work mainly because of the ability to split the screen up it works wonderfully for that purpose but i love it even more for just the day to day tasks being able to see everything on one screen has just solved a problem i never knew i had it honestly changed the way i use my computer \\n\\nnow for the gaming aspect i am not a hard core gamer but the visual quality and size of the screen makes my wifes sims game look unbelievable once again just being able to see so much more with the 49 display

gaming best experience this review was collected as part of a promotion awesome thanks and keep up the good work \\ni know that i will keep buying more had this game for a while now and i can say with the recent updates and new dlc that released for fallout 4 this game is amazing its a perfect mix of rpg and action gameplay i highly recommend this game to anyone who is a fan of fallout i know games are supposed to evolve and change as time goes by but i feel like the new fallout is a complete let down im not a hardcore fan but those are the only ones that i can see enjoying this game when you get pummeled nonstop after leveling up there must be a problem with either me or the game and i think its the game i tried giving it a fair chance but when you feel like a weakling with the only time your strong is in a suit of power armor and even then your still weak due to having to repower your armor every 30 minutes if your a hardcore fallout fan you might like it but for me this was an absolute waste id have more fun playing superman 64 i am new to fallout and purchased this game after hearing my friends liked it they had played fallout 3 and new vegas and said this game would be great and gave it a lot of hype the game was a little bit slow at the beginning but once you leave the vault and complete a couple story missions you become addicted fast i played for hours one day just customizing my settlement adding defenses and salvaging supplies the customization is insane as it should be in a fallout game ive created several weapon mods pieces of armor and looted anything i can find the experience point system is pretty good too and the story can get a little boring at times especially when you get bombarded by preston garvey to help another settlement the graphics are mediocre but thats not the reason people play fallout if you are discouraged at the beginning keep playing a little while longer and you might find yourself loving this game i was not a fan of skyrim but i am a fan of this game this is game of the year material indeed and deserves every recognition it has recieved there are a lot of people who hate on this game for one reason or another but in reality the hate is not needed this is one of the few games made that holds its replay value over many times of replaying the game the graphics may not be as good as other games that have come out in recent years but thats not the point of the game fallout 4 is a very deep game in terms of content and not many games do that i like this game but it did not live up to my hype you should get this game but it is not my favorite at all fallout 4 has been a wonderful experience for me it had a great main story line and awesome side quests with different moods and themes it did a good job of introducing the premise to new players and solidifying and reviving the gamer for long time fallout players it has been an awesome game and i have used it to bond with my also gamer parents excellent story line that keeps me coming back good graphics weapon selection and story options that i just find very interesting amazing game i would of asked for this game for christmas but i didnt think that i would like it it is good for all kinds of gamers from the look of it it seams kinda like farcry 4 with a dark twist and more buildings i suggest playing this even if your someone who only owns call of duty i love all the fallout games this is the best one of all this game is fun i am still playing and i love it ive been playing for days know and still not bored it is the best game of all time  i personally enjoy fallout 4 very much from listening to classic songs on diamond city radio to discovering a new location and killing some ghouls however this seems very reminiscent of my experience with fallout 3 i must say fallout 4 seems more like fallout 35 which isnt a bad thing to say to be called a better version of a critically acclaimed game with updated graphics a new place different characters and new systems vats slows down time instead of stopping and new perks system it is just as good if not better than fallout 3 fallout 4 takes a few steps away from its core without becoming a new series also it is more filled with life than the brown and silver locals in fallout 3 finally fallout 4 is a great game and people should not be deterred from buying from my review first off i have a question why is the spacebar used for so many tasks this alone has led to countless deaths not even on the hardest difficulty and should never have been allowed to happen if youre picky about your controls and being able to customize them dont get this game another complaint i have about customization which is twofold why are the options under extras of all places and graphics settings dont even exist if my computer is running anything in the background i cannot play this game because i cant turn down the graphics settings from gorgeous to performance oh wait i can turn dynamic shadows and antialiasing on and off because that makes all the difference no wait it doesnt finally my third problem with this game if youre a hardcore mass effect fan as i was do not buy this game if you dont get the from ashes dlc it will not feel like a finished game then again even with that dont get it for the story as the ending trying to avoid spoilers is the worst ending to a game i have seen in an ea title much less a bioware title ive played call of duty games with better endings and i dont even like those games ranting aside the gameplay itself is epic and it is definitely a fun game especially the multiplayer if youre in it for the gameplay this game is definitely worth buying other than the spacebar it has the feel of an ea game rather than a bioware game however so im conflicted on whether or not to recommend this game the final installment of mass effect was fantastic all the through until the end the final battle felt a little underrated considering this was the build up for the series in the past five years there have been a lot of complaints about small details at the ending but i wont say any in the event i spoil it for someone my only complaint about the ending is how sloppily it felt in mass effect standards which is fairly high this game is well worth the money even still though and is a fantastic experience you cant miss out on this game ends a great trilogy and is a great investment of money if you played any of the previous games this game will be twice as good but it is not unapproachable if you havent some people complain about the ending but there are 3 reasons this shouldnt discourage you from buying 1 developers have already agreed to write a new ending and are probably going to patch the game with it in the future 2 the whole game is great enough especially the whole series to make the bad ending only a minor deterrence in a great game and 3 story doesnt affect its multiplayer which is enjoyable as well if you are looking into a new series to play start with the first mass effect and play through to this one it is a very worthwhile experience developers update the game and listen to feedback and dlc is available great game up until the last 10 minutes now i wish i never would of played mass effect i dont understand what the writers were thinking on this one game was overall amazing like all the mass effects the multiplayer gets really boring and is repetitive the ending is horrible for singleplayer rumors are saying that bioware is releasing the real ending thats a dlc called truth it takes place on the last collector ship and in multiplayer you will be able to play as a geth bataron\\ufeff and prothen the game engine is beautiful the multiplayer coop is fun and challenging the story itself throughout is fun and enjoyable plus they do an amazing job of tying the events of the previous two games together and making you feel like your choices matter\\n\\nin the end though they dont the ending is so sloppily and lazily done it destroyed the whole franchise choices no longer matter as deus ex machina tears apart the choose your own adventure style of storyline for a force railroad that leaves the joy of playing these games bloody and broken on the tracks\\n\\ni cant even bring myself to try to play and enjoy the mp aspects of it anymore theres just no point i know the ending i know my choices dont matter and in a fit of intellectual laziness the devs have sauntered off to collect my money\\n\\ni give this 4 stars because there are some redeeming parts of the game i wont give it any more because it has destroyed its own replay value through the terrible conclusion i hate to say it but this is the game swtor should have been graphics are very sharp and crisp at 19201080story is incredible and gameplay is simply alot of fun id rather play games of this quality several times through than pay monthly for any mmo dont miss out on this potential game of the year graphics and sound were great i gave gameplay an average because as a squad shooter its just that controls are tight but even when set to use abilities squad members frequently wont i had to manually activate ashleys marksman ability most of the time also while you can order your squadmates to move somewhere they wont always stay which results in them getting killed by heavy fire because they left the good position you had them in\\n\\nthe games storyline was good but the ending was atrocious it is wrapping up a trilogy of games i expected two things first that it would show me glimpses of the main characters lives in the aftermath secondly that it would have a happy ending yes i got the good one the ending was fifteen seconds of footage showing joker and two other seemingly random characters it was in short pun intended awful\\n\\ni had to rate lasting appeal low for that reason i cant imagine replaying the game to see that ending also there is about 10 minutes of dialogue at the end that cannot be skipped after how wonderful the journey was i cannot fully express my disappointment in how poorly executed its end turned out to be perfect for my speech room i love that i can take out little sections when needed and then put them all back at the end of the day sturdy colorful spacious multiple potential uses these are perfect for my daughters desks in our homeschool room they are a great size  are already helping to keep daily supplies nearathand and organized the storage center is so useful for crafters one can easily organize their craft tools and remove one bin at a time depending on the tools they need i do wish the base was a turntable however it is nice that small openings are notched in the bottom of the tray to allow for picking up and moving i love it and wish i had more this is a great product to store materials or use with centers i love the fact that the the containers are removable the colors are bright and students enjoy using this storage center i have used it in a a variety of ways including storing materials for a writing center as well as a math center i would recommend this product to any educator who is looking for an organizational storage space this review was collected as part of a promotion i used this product in two ways at first i just used it to store writing utensils at my small group table then i decided to use it as a centers materials organizer since each bin is removable the student is able to take the bin to hisher desk this little organization system is great for children the fact that each section is removable is very helpful we love it this review was collected as part of a promotion these organization pockets help me to keep important classroom items in a place where i can easily locate them i always know where my dry erase markers are until i received these i would spend minutes at a time trying to find them now i have a designated place for them im thrilled and so are my students we have been using them for exit slips and storage areas for some classroom center materials they are so wellmade and colorful i would highly recommend them for a teacher who is looking for a way to keep items organized got this to use during center time in the center of 48 round table i love the size it could sit in the center of the table and not intrude into students work space can put pencil in center but found outer buckets could hold pencils just as well this allowed me to make the center cup for my supplies and outer buckets for students supplies it is sturdy and well made both students and teacher could rotate it without any trouble held general items needed at the table without spilling or tipping over small bins can be removed as needed but rooted so easily never needed to remove could easily assign individual buckets to students we did drop it on the tile floor once and none of the plastic cracked or broke i am planning on purchasing two more for my other two tables this review was collected as part of a promotion i received this product as part of an incentivized review program i cannot explain how much i love this storage center i am currently using the storage center as part of my writing center in my kindergarten classroom this organizational space is compromised of 8 smaller containers on a circular tray the containers are the perfect size for crayons scissors erasers markers and glue sticks i love how the smaller containers on the lazy susan stand are removable students can take a smaller container out if needed the students love using this at their writing station and makes clean up a breeze my once messy writing station is now perfectly organized i would recommend this product to any classroom teacher regardless of age to help with organizing the classroom this review was collected as part of a promotion live the curved design features that enhance the quality to look almost as if they 3d this review was collected as part of a promotion my company for video and photo editing with clients \\neven my clients want to purchase one  i would of gave this 5 stars the only cons i could think is the hdr is not the best but for 28 inch this hdr is fine also this is just my personal preference but it would be nice if the ports were alittle bit more easy access understanding the majority of gaming monitors are built like this and just fyi anyone connecting a ps5 or gaming console u have to go into the settings and change the input type to av this will give u 4k 120hz thought i share case it was driving me insane other than that this

a promotion i am a teacher and the first time i used the designer silicone band for apple watch  by dabney lee  lemony several of my students from different classes complimented my “new watch” i heard things like “how fun” to “i love the colors” needless to say this band is an eye catcher besides being beautiful i love that it looks high quality and stylish in addition the buckle closure allowed me to find just the right place for the watch to be differently from other bands it does not get sticky after a workout and i have washed it several times due to covid prevention and the colors are as bright and beautiful as day one this review was collected as part of a promotion i tried designer silicone band for apple watch by dabney leelemony and its super cute for sure its super easy to use adjustable buckle that will allow the band to fit most wrist its made out of soft durable silicone and its really comfortable to wear  it securely attaches to 38mm and 40mm apple watches  there are more colors but this one with the lemons is adorable and looks great on my arm i love it fallout 4 is a step back from fallout 3 and new vegas and really shows that bethesda has failed to innovate much in terms of their game engine graphics or gameplay what they do is pretty cool but it is becoming stale and in the wake of the witcher 3 the bad story and lack of any meaningful choices is made that much more glaring that said i had fun but this could have been so much more and i genuinely hope that bethesda will learn from their mistakes  instead of just swimming in their cash  and deliver the next elder scrolls game with upgrades and improvements across the board so i am a big fallout fan and got the pipboy edition on the ps4 the wait felt like forever and i couldnt wait to finally get back into the wasteland overall i like the game like making cool settlements crafting etc but there is one problem that i find very noticeable after completing the main quests there is not enough side quests in this game and after you go around looking at places you slowly start to realize that there is not much else to do the repeating quests are annoying after some time and you just stop doing those i saw a comparison between quests in fallout 4 and skyrim skyrim nearly doubles all of fallout 4s quests all together so it sucks that bethesda didnt add more now this is where dlc comes into play so people will have to buy dlc to be able to play more quests the other fallout games seem to have more things to do in my opinion although fallout 4 has lots of different main quests that include i think 34 different factions to choose from so returning back to the game and trying something new is always something to look forward to but i noticed that within the first 10 mins of the game i felt like something was missing im still not sure why i thoughtthink that but it just didnt have the full fallout feel to it even though it is a wasteland overall i still like the game but am disappointed in the lack of quests in the game i guess the only thing to really look up to is the mods which hopefully come to xboxps4 and to see how well the dlc plays out 7510 fallout 4 is one of those special games that only happened once in a blue moon if you havent gotten around to playing it yet get to it you wont be disappointed the game is amazing everything about it is awesome i just cant wait to see what they have coming for dlc this is a must get game good game its good goo game play good everything i play for hours its good its nice its cool this game is pure great do i snipe shotgun pistol melee or do i pull out my power armor to kill with there just too many ways to go into a battle the minute i started playing i was hooked bethesda payed close attention to feedback from fallouts new vegas and 3 and really improved a much as possible excellent storyline setting and graphics all around great game i was skeptical at first from some of the reviews ive seen but turns out this is one amazing game the moment i heard this announced i was excited to experience it the game has not let me down and the only bad thing i have to say besides the gliches is that the story is not as good as new vegass story i will acknowledge that there is a lot about this game that is amazing my main complaints are the very common crashes and bugs there is nothing worse than having your game crash and having to redo what you just did my game has crashed at least 15 times and i have gotten stuck in places and had to reload at least 5 after lvl 20 i had to play on the hardest difficulty to have any fun and even then the only real challenge is finding ammo i have tossed out 95 of the legendary armor and weapons i get because they are pointless this game was clearly produced with giant holes they intend to fill later with dlc new weapons power armor upgrades new furniture etc i have used the same gun for 30lvls building a village was one thing i was seriously looking forward to but they managed to ruin it by making it mostly cosmetic and tedious the best guns and armor will always be bought elsewhere and having a camp barely helps you in game and constantly having to build and defend new ones with no gain gets old quick it could be a great game bethesda has great ideas but putting out a bug infested game thats not finished was a bad idea this review was collected as part of a promotion i have used my storage center on my guided reading table since i got my storage center i have received positive comments from both staff and students the vivid colors match my students desk organizers i would definitely recommend this tool to school staff to keep their desk or centers more organized this review was collected as part of a promotion this product has cleaned up my desk and closet i was able to organize items that the kids dont keep on their tables so they constantly need my help getting with this the items like scissors glue makers colored pencils post its high lighters are all out and visible and if one table needs a particular item they are able to get to it quick and easy like these old games but they should have been put on 1 disk instead of 3 not a lot of data required for 8 bit games they only did it to make more money rob the consumer do not let the 3 stars on graphics mislead you  for anyone who has nostalgia for playing the atari 2600 and atari arcade games any of the volumes of this series is a must  again for those who love the classic games  anyone who was raised on 1080p graphics 3d modeled action games may not enjoy this as much so take this under consideration as they may be disappointed  for all those who love the classic games from the 70s this is the games we love and missed  excellent for introducing a gaming newbie to the gaming world while reliving the games of old the flashback classic took me back to my childhoodthe games are just as i remember themthe grahics are terrible if want to compare them to todays  video game but still fun i grew up playing the atari 2600 and its various games so i was thrilled to stumble onto volum three with the 5200 system thanks so much for the games folks like i played atari 5200

cute band this review was collected as part of a promotion great band to switch out for the springsummertime fashionable very flexible and soft but sturdy and comfortable on my small wrist it is adjustable in small increments for various size wrists it is easy to change out the band it says its the no shoes no shirt all service edition but its the standard edition this is to be expected for a preowned game but it shouldnt be advertised this way just look at box if you buy this for anything other than spraying water on anime girls with tig ol bitties then why else would you buy it for theres a target audience for this type of game and i can guarantee you if you are in this audience then buy it if not go play some other genre im enjoying the characters the combat is fun and i dont feel like im fighting the mechanics if you love anibewbies you’ll love this game but for real gameplay is actually fun simple and addicting im gay and people question why i play games like this its so i can see all my weeb straight friends faces when certain parts happen ha i dont really play first person shooter games but i like how gameplay is here glad i dived back into this series with this installment it’s very different than previous titles for good measure to really mix it up i figured it would be similar to splatoon however it stands on its own great 3rd person shooter if you play it for that great game recommended by employee at monroe street store clocked in 30 plus hours so far love the art  lots of skin  playstation had to censor parts because sjws ridiculous ingame censorship  username not allowed as license plate great fun without the expense where else could i drive hot cars as fast as i want and not get a ticket i really enjoy this game i have them all i gotta 5 always like the forza games can not go wrong with any of them the game has changed too much its a racing game that has now incorporated creating a character that you need to put different clothes on im not interested in those types of games and why i choose racing games as such excellent game better then all others i had it b4 but son took it so i bought again love it with wheel and pedals the more you drive the more points you get towards news cars and skills even when you crash into things so you’ll never loose points for being a bad driver it’s a amazing game at an amazing price thanks gamestop bought this for my teenage son  he absolutely loves it  hours of gameplay beautiful graphics realistic physics beautiful environmental details to go along with a smooth driving experience while your behind the wheel driving i first played fallout 3 when it came out i then played fallout new vegas when it came out first thing i did was buy fallout 4 and i enjoyed it a lot the story line was great and the graphics looked much more realistic than its prequels had before ive waited 3 weeks to pass judgment on this game so i could fully try out everything and experience as much as i could first off ive had a lot of fun playing it it was tough at first but i got to be at a level playing field with the mobs at around level 15 there were times when i would roll through what looked liked a deserted town just to find out it was full of ghouls that would attack you like zombies from the movie 28 days i really started to enjoy myself then theres so much to do between quest missions building settlements scavenging for supplies and just exploring the world at first i had a lot of fun building the settlements building defenses and walling off the perimeter to protect the settlement just to find out its pretty much all for nothing if you dont see the little notification of a settlement being attacked because your on a quest in the workshop menu or just plain distracted at the time since you have to be there to defend it youll go back to all your crops defenses and generators wrecked and having to be repaired its quite frustrating to have 40 water 40 food 20 settlers and 140 defense just to find out its all for nothing if you cant be there to help defend the whole point of building these defenses is to leave the settlement knowing they are defended but if youre not there to help defend it a few raiders can just walk in and destroy everything pretty dumb and a waste of time if you ask me i even tried double walls on one of my smaller settlements with no way in or out only way in was to fast travel to the marker inside the walls and it still got wrecked so dont waste too much of your time or resources building up defenses cause it wont matter if youre not there to defend it and youll just have to use a lot more resources to repair everything other than that i really enjoy the game the sounds of distant firefights in the distance that you can join in or avoid is outstanding the way you can collect different power armor suits is great i havent ran into any of the bugs that have been reported so ive been lucky there just remember to save often im not all too pleased with this purchase ill tell you my biggest peeve with this game you know how in fallout 3 you had to work real hard for your power armor well in this one youre handed your armor in the first like 3 missions yep now you have a set of over powered armor to use the rest of the game albeit they require fusion cores to operate which you find very scarcely other than that it really just feels like fallout 3 with amazing graphics nothing much new here pretty disappointed i would recommend to a friend just because i know this is just my feeling about this game a ton of others love it i recommend hardcore gamers because im on easy difficulty and im getting wrecked constantly for some reason the game is pretty solid i like the settlement crafting system i literally spent hours build walls and fortifying each settlement i have yet to play the game but the graphics look amazing cant wait to get it hope to get it for christmas when you hear about a game company spending 4 years making a game you expect it to be goodno you expect it to be freaking awesome and that my friends is what bethesda has done with fallout 4 ive you have played any of the previous games than you know what you are in for a massive world with so much to explore as always there is the main story line quests but you dont have to stay on them for long afterall there is a huge world to explore a lot of elements are brought into this game from its older versions but there is so much new stuff as well so do i like it well of course i do a game that is so massive and open and that lets you make your own dang mind up about what you will do and how you will respond is right up my alley if you like those things and dont have this game yetwhat are you waiting for head on over to your local gamestop and then be prepared to say goodbye to your entire life you wont want to put your control downok ok maybe just to use the bathroom because if you didnt do thatoh ugh never mind get fallout 4 this review was collected as part of a promotion i wanted to change up the look of my apple watch so i decided to switch out the band for this lemon one  its so cute  it was very easy to switch the band and it fits the watch perfectly  very happy with this i had really high hopes for this game when i heard it was being released i just finished today and i was so disappointed with it that it made me write my first review about a game there was too much copy and paste it felt like i was doing the same mission over and over no variety all i heard about was how advanced the crafting system will be really what crafting system you cant craft anything all you can do is modify the weapons and armor you find and all the armor you find is the same stuff you find in fallout 3 nothing different think about how much better skyrim was then oblivion and the witcher 3 over the witcher 2 i was expecting that kind of jump with this game especially with it being on the new generation console it failed horribly its fallout 3 with better graphics this review was collected as part of a promotion i received this cute lemon watch band and am pleased with the quality of it its cute and trendy easy to use and comfortable since its silicone it is easy to wash and wont get ruined would make a good gift for a teen when i first got this i was very skeptical and didnt know what to think with some of the games i have played on a ps4 i was a little disappointed in the graphics i ended up sticking with it and just enjoyed the game and the further i got into the game the more and more i grew to love it now i cannot put the controller down i am probably 15 or more hours into the game and its absolutely amazing i recommend this to anyone the gameplay is a little different at first but as soon as you get use to it you will take off and enjoy every bit of it there is so much to do and explore that it never gets boring no mission is exactly the same it keeps everything mixed up so you dont feel like you are doing the same thing over and over if you are contemplating whether or not to get this game i extremely recommend it one of the top games i have played in a very long time this review was collected as part of a promotion i enjoy collecting casual fun watch bands for my apple watch this lemony design is incredibly cute and fits well but what i love most about it is how it feels the silicone is so smooth and soft it feels good wearing it i know it’s weird but i like to pet it  oh and the brush metal buckle is a nice classy touch to this casual band  i’m a big fan this a grate game if u havent purchesed online its a huge open world sandbox game it has endless things to do its a grate game im nit a flip in robot so a real person saying this just buy it who wats fallout to be game of the year dno one well u suck lol buyyyyyy this review was collected as part of a promotion the dabney lee lemony silicone band is so cute  the details is well printed and fits right on my apple watch its very easy to install and great quality band will buy another band with different design not only do you get to play this amazing new chapter in fallout you get to be part of creating this new world love the stripes so fun to wear  it’s lightweight and very comfortable this review was collected as part of a promotion honestly there is nothing wrong with this monitor the picture will be top quality and will be among the best on the market the problem here lies with the money can you afford it do you have the space for such a huge monitor and also can your pc handle it if you

seat up lol good game for youngsters fun game and keeps you busy for hours on end the game didn’t work at all and couldn’t get past the starting screen really disappointed 15 would not recommend i thought i was done with this type of game but i find myself getting pulled back in and these games are great licensed games if your child likes batman and legos this is definitely a game to have great graphics its ok my son enjoyed watching my wife and i play for him good game had a few issues with it to start but was able to fix the problem now works just fine fun game for my grandson he loves this game and it was on sale 999 ok lego game sometimes its unclear how or what to do to move on i am a big lego fan this game didnt disappoint the game play and obstacles can sumetimes be frustrating but over all i liked it i love this game i love all the lego games but this one is special in that the player can play the hero levels then turn around and play the villain levels that show how things got started  i love that dichotomy mediocre gameplay with mediocre story the girls are very pretty though gameplay isnt amazing but it delivers the same perv joy as the rest of the series great fan service underwhelming gameplay played it a bit and felt it lacking where triple a third person fps thrive enjoyable and fun love the art style and happy go lucky gameplay this game has good graphics and i like the characters and there cloting got the game as a joke stream i knew what i was getting myself into however i bought the game new and it didnt come with any codes all the fanservice you could possibly ask for and as a casual in the anime world i can say i was very overwhelmed in a positive way when playing this game with my friends a full 10 out of 10 this game takes all the humor and strange situations and fanservice of the senran kagura franchise and brings it to the tps genre the game is very fun and has a solid combat system that once again shows that the people who make this franchise know how to make a good game fanservice or not while it doesnt push the ps4 to the edge it looks great and plays at a solid 60fps while some content will not be for everybody it will prove to be an immense delight to any fan of the franchise or really anyone who loves these wired quirky niche japanese titles amazing japanese third person shooter with good story to it awesome game good combat and sweet visuals absolutely brilliant i got an xbox series s and finally played forza horizon 4 and it’s valid i love this game best car game seasons suck though the cars customization and painting are cool the drifting and racing are fun too i didn’t like it it was a literal three hour tutorial wasted time and money never again do not buy this crap game you have never played a real racing game until youve played forza horizon 4 tuning can be a bit frustrating or i would give it 5 stars ive been having a lot of fun going around britain racing my friend and i can honestly say that the game has some really good mechanics when it comes to customizing your car and destroying some of the maps structures such as stone walls small trees bushes etc the game is nothing short of incredible i haven’t been into racing games in so long and i kept hearing about forza so i gave it a shot the intro is exactly how an intro should be stop reading and get it now i think it’s about 20 bucks now but i got it black friday for 15 i would gladly buy it at 60 game stop is great microsoft is a ripoff don’t waste your money buy something else from a game stop don’t fall for the fake reviews graphics are amazing driving around a lot of fun some of the challenges seem a little unrealistic in comparison to other forza games way to much to try and keep track of between pr stunts and racing  then you add in seasonal and forzathon challenges it just got to annoying to keep playing love the quality of seasons and how i can manage vehicle drive through the whole event\\r\\ni might need more updates because ive planned on keeping this game longer than a month bought it as a gift for friends kid for christmas arrived on time and he loves it this review was collected as part of a

work \\nto and play ps5 on this review was collected as part of a promotion yes i like to play games and everything gta is my games this review was collected as part of a promotion i use it for gamingstreaming and work\\nit is great for all 3 of these this review was collected as part of a promotion great refresh rate perfect for call of duty and competitive fps this is a very good game so here is a list of pros and cons because i dont want to write paragraphs for the viewers who are just looking for quick reviews pros good story love the fact that there is a dog following you around and helping love the customization building settlements is fun and i like the shooting systemcons graphics could be better but not a big deal i dont like the fact that the pond by a settlement i have cant have the radiation removed an the last thing is that this game is much harder than the previous fallouts i was getting my butt kicked traveling anywhere outside of the nw corner of the map all that needed to be done was i lowered the difficulty until i can level up so not a big dealso i would say give this game a try this review was collected as part of a promotion i use this monitor for mainly racing simulation  there is not another monitor that comes close imo its so much thing to do on this game you will never get boredlike the side missions its like its unlimitedin the story missions are long its not easy goingthats the fun of it a challenge thats the type of game you needso all i got to say about fallout 4 best game of the year this review was collected as part of a promotion i use it for games tv shows it has an amazing picture and features i was unbelievably stoked for this and it totally matched up to the hype before i list what i love but i will point out what i see as the two main issues 1 they really hindered role playing not a huge thing for me but i know this really bothers a lot of people the voiced protagonist and dialogue options really hurt this method of playing 2 they removed the karma system this really bothers me as i always saw this as a really cool defining characteristic of the fallout series and i just dont understand why they would remove this this also kind of ties in to the first issue however they really did make an excellent game i think the synth story line really encapsulates the red scare era that fallout has always had your neighbor could be a synth your neighbor could be a commie the base building has eaten away hours of my life its incredible could use some tweaks but it is their first time implementing it so overall a success the map may technically be smaller but its so much more content filled than previous games with just tons to do overall incredible game i already have dozens of hours into and i would 100 recommend it ive played both fallout 3 and fallout newvegas and have to say that they were fun and all but nowhere near fallout 4 firstly we all have to agree that the gameplay and graphic quality are boosted and not to mention the customization and i just love that we have a fully viced character to go along with all of the awesomeness of the game so allinall i give it a 1010 this game is absolutely terrible no plot to the story i didnt think i would say this but way too big extremely boring dont buy i am seeing reviews that compare fallout 4 to call of duty i didnt have that feeling when i played it had felt like a good ol fallout game its an rpg that has guns with so much variations of course there is going to be the sense of a shoot em up but thats minus the little kids spewing out words that us adults dont say over the internet dont forget you have a melee system and you are able to customize hand to hand combat weapons\\n\\ni lost the track of time because this game is very entertaining the graphics may not be the best to other gamers but i thought they were great in comparison to the past fallouts and it being nextgen keep in mind you are going to have glitches or some other issue it is no different from the other fallouts or the other great titles someone had mentioned the witcher iii that game had a 17gb update shortly after they released dlc as long as you let the developers know they will fix it it isnt the end of the world regardless of the sticker price of the game every highly anticipated game is going to have bugglitch fixes\\n\\nyou want a game that will entertain you for continuous hours this is the game for you especially if you are a fallout fan you are able to build and customize just about anything and dont forget about all those amazing perks to make your character just as awesome as you are cheers aside from a grueling walk this game raises the bar for how games should be when done right i have next to no problems a few glitches here and there but for such a vast world that has been built i see no reason why this game should not be game of the year i commend the developers into putting such detail into a marvelous earthbound journey and await the next adventure to come i personally like this game yeah it has some glitches hopefully bethesda will fix soon the targeting is off and the pipboy will not open up after building in a settlement i like being able to build stuff the downside of this game is the fusion cores needed for the power armor and when you get rads it now makes your health bar red preventing you from healing all the way overall its still a good game and i am having alot of fun playing it this game has left a ton to the imagination and has completely lived up to its hype amazing open world good graphics gameplay to die for this is a must buy game and will definitely be goty another fallout and another success for bethesda i love this game imy looking forward to putting in the hours to complete everything the game gets a bit repetitive but its a good fun time killer its absolutely fan service and definitly not for the younger crowd as the humiliation move thing is pretty lewd so you wouldnt want your kiddos playing it probably but over all pretty good though not sure it 40 worth of good had it not come with the extras id for sure say not still a fun game though for anime fans i wanted to try something new and senran kagura has become my latest addiction in a good way honestly i didnt care for the characters but after putting in alot of hours with estival versus i learn more about the characters and their backstories without even playing the original titles i highly recommend the game if you enjoy games like naruto storm series and doa with an all female cast when i got it i did not know what it was like but it is fun for the price it is you get a really good art book with alot of pages and each picture is great on every page also the soundtrack cd is also worth it as it has 47 tracks and each song is pretty good my 7 year old son asked for this game he has enjoyed every moment of playing it he’s even saving his own money so he can buy the 2nd game this game is a blast to play there is a vr mode included in the game which is a plus the dead or alive characters as add on content is a bonus and reasonably priced if you like splatoon and anime girls in various swimsuits and styles then i highly recommend this title i bought this for my boys and they absolutely love it the game is great the graphics are amazing but the game is very unbalanced and need to be worked on but over than that i love it my son loves the game sooooooo much he cant stop playing the game its a very enjoyable game to play if you like cute girls and squirt guns this is seriously the game for ya silly fun and a vacation away from home the game itself is great but i bought a used copy and it froze as soon as i popped it in if you buy it buy it new what was promised fanservice they promised anime girls in bikinis having water gun fights dont expect something that will change gaming forever like assassins creed or grand theft auto the game delivers what it promised and is a lot of fun the game is rated m so keep that in mind it is a decent game but if your looking for epicness get lego batman 2 dc superheros that game looks a lot better splatoonlike shooter but with anime girls definitely not for everyone and full of fanservice  i loved this game for my ps3 i had like a lot of fun playing levels and building stuff during cinematics i sometimes laugh what robin is doing the only con about this game is 1 hit enemy dies im not the best at expressing so i will just say i enjoy the aesthetics and the characters but especially the gameplay which to me makes it the most fun since it literally is to me a fast paste third person shooter with lots of cool characters  fanservice well i have to say the game play is good but it is short and there is no upgrades i dont like it fun game more games need to be lighthearted and include this amount of extra content  artbooks cd and bluray of videos first off i played this game for the ps2 but i feel as though the ps3 version is not different other than enhanced graphics i completely beat this game and found all of the minikits red bricks etc it is a very fun game and easy for younger gamers to play and also enjoy there are a lot of characters to play as many of them are from the comic books i have played and completed the lego star wars one and two and thoroughly enjoyed those so basically take lego star wars and place batman in instead batman and robin each have unique suits that help to acquire minkits and red bricks overall for legolovers and someone who wants a simple and entertaining game pick up lego batman ive always been skeptical of lego games but after this i cant wait to play lego potc and harry potter ive loved batman my whole life and nothing is more satisfying as a gamerfan than picking this up and finding that it actually did him justice it was fun playing as batman and robin and then getting to see the villains perspective the gameplay was fun and simple but the game did have its challenges you actually had to think about your next move in order to solve problems correctly i think the grunts are the most amazings sounds ever i love how they dont talk i played batman arkham asylum before this even though this game is older and found some similarities that i though were pretty coolthe best part about it was 2 player me and my little brother got to enjoy this together and it was so exciting if you love batman you shouldve played this game already if youre not a fan for whatever reason play it anyway i promise its a great experience fun graphics are great but fails everywhere else not exciting to play at all i find myself bored within the first 5 minutes of picking it up way too many missions to keep track of missing a lot of cars from previous games customization is pretty vanilla this game has no soul the weekly events are so frustrating because its overly hard to beat and not rewarding bringing seasons and all the different changes that brings does well the player customizationclothingetc could be better but this is the only real complaint i have as far as the gameplay itself it really does very well easy to get hooked this game has a lasting appeal the graphics are realistic and the gameplay has a variation unlike any other car game i’ve played it’s absolutely given you all sorts of styled racing you want and enough goals and rewards to chance  become your own goal junky adventure is great in the normal gameplay but  if that’s not enough purchase more and the ocean gets even deeper can you say “submarine deep sea” you also enjoy designing your own cars’ styles  graphics and tuning  or borrow someone else’s  take your pick and to top it off  all this changes for you through the four seasons “boom my mind literally exploded” definitely the forza franchise really did they homework with this game forza horizon 4 is a must have for anyone into car games it could have been much better without that forzathon garbage around half of my favorite cars are locked behind it its a shame they had to go this way i honestly do not care about rarity i think everyone should be able to enjoy what car they want without this insult of unlocking it i think even a 1 star is still far too generous for this game the driving in horizon 4 and graphics are great but not the forzathon and not being able to buy the cars at the showroom i know this review wont change anything going back to horizon 1 this is similar to other horizon titles it’s a great change with the seasons the map completely changes big ups playing the game is great however i wish there was a bigger map to explore this one is a trifle couped up i love this game it’s so realistic and the scenery is just breathtaking i play it all the time excellent game graphics are better tha ever an the car collection is absurdly huge great overall game you should buy this game if you really like cars from all brands and also like tuningthe game gives you a huge number of cars to chose from and 4 types of raceswith exclusive events and also limited time eventsif you watch donut media mo powah baby andor deoxide because you like animecars and forza then you should buy it this review was collected as part of a promotion good looking and comfort to eye for real gaming monitor with good refresh rate this review was collected as part of a promotion i use my monitor for streaming videos or playing games online i prefer streaming videos or watching it over playing games on the odyssey monitor\\n\\nit is very appealing to watch videos on

promotion personal use for at home and everyday use all around a good thing to have this review was collected as part of a promotion picture is sharp color is perfect love the design this review was collected as part of a promotion recomendé this product i love this monitor  i would like to have it  ive seen all kinds of videos on him and hes excellent  it suits me for my streaming soon i was worried at first that this game wasnt going to live up to the hype im relieved to say that this game is a step in the right direction for the fallout series im going to start this with a reminder that unlike what some would like to believe this is my opinion whether or not you like it is up to you\\n\\nfallout 3 and new vegas to me were great games although their charm wore off quickly or started just a little too slowly for my taste they wouldnt last long on consoles but for pc theyre pretty much infinitely replayable due to its modding community this game nailed the pacing\\n\\ninitially as i started it felt a little weird playing this not due to sloppy controls but more due to the extensive changes made to the ui after about an hour or two with the game though it quickly wears off as pretty soon youll just as fast or even faster than you would in the previous fallout games the game controls nicely and feels fluid this was especially good because in the last two the controls were kinda stiff and occasionally acted weird but this made it work fast and not drop input as often as i thought it would\\n\\nthe graphics while great have some issues i noticed some strange lighting in certain areas where there wasnt a source which struck me as odd and kind of took me out but otherwise was done quite well some textures are kinda low res but with a game this size im not surprised at it otherwise this game is gorgeous bethesdas efforts at overhauling a game that still admittedly had that 2007 feel to them was not wasted and for the most part everything works the way it should the colors while you might think is something superfluous i think matters in this fallout its bright but still has that level of wear and tear from both the nuclear bomb damage and 200 years of everything thrown its way rather than maintaining that same muddy color scheme that tended to look rather depressing at times the prewar setting still at least has some soul to it\\n\\nfor gameplay its gotten quite a few new additions besides the standard shooter mechanics which have been round off quite well bethesda now shows us what it means to have a deeper sense of interactivity modding weapons returns from new vegas returns with quite a twist allowing for mods to be created from scratch using the new scrap system and they arent just for looks or some minor buff these are mods that have trade offs but also huge advantages to allow different playstyles to emerge the settlements while i think a good idea on paper tend to feel like they get in the way i never thought that they shouldnt be implemented but i find that constantly being shown that a base isnt operating well at all when i was just starting out to be annoying as it almost expected me to just drop my initial questing to fix things up with zero scrap if it were up to me i would have allowed it at a little bit of a later level when youve gotten most of your startup out of the way cooking has now been implemented which actually is somewhat good as cooked food will be much better for you than just eating stuff raw speaking of which the health system has been revised as well instead of having a rad counter it now sort of locks off part of your health bar which makes sense to me and foodhealing items are now all time based which makes for some extra planning vats and the ap system have also gotten some changes with vats no longer pausing action completely but slowing it down to add a little bit more of that hectic feel to a fight and you can now sprint which uses ap critical hits are measured on a meter and kills in vats raises it encouraging you to use it the leveling system is an interesting one most fans of the previous fallout games will say that the removal of the skill system is some form of sacrilege but i find it to be fine rather than having skills and perks your special stats are now the determining factor of the perks you get leveling up gives you one allocation point that can be either applied to one of the perk levels on a special or the special attribute itself there is no longer a level cap which is quite nice and allows for the possibility of fully leveling a character you know that previous junk that you probably only used once in a blue moon with the rockit launcher now its part of the scrap system where you will desperately searching for anything that you can use to craft weapon mods or things for your settlements and it can get quite hectic at times no longer are all items you find pointless power armor has changed as well previous games saw you getting a perk that allowed you to wear the armor and then you would wear it for the forseeable future due to its potent effects compared to most other armor now power armor has its own unique feel rather than acting like a second skin which wasnt supposed to be the intent based on the art design power armor has impact you really feel like a hulking monster walking around in a suit that allows for you to hit the snot out of your enemies and other kinds of things while this may make it sound like its even more overpowered than before it isnt and thats because it requires a fusion core to work otherwise youll be forced to walk around and you wont able to use vats while inside an empty suit it also can take damage on specific parts so your limbs can be exposed if you take too much damage armor customization has also become a feature which applies to both the power armor and normal armor normal armor allows for you to choose a base vault 111 suit long johns harness etc right arm plating left arm plating right leg plating left leg plating and a helmet glasses and mouth covering or just a full helmetmask power armor uses the mainframe of any suit but allows for different effects to be applied to different areas to allow for playstyle\\n\\nthe story is one where a simple motivation is all it needed is it perfect not all the time the writing can fail to make you feel something but most of the time you definitely feel as though you make an impact based upon your actions the whole goal of the game is to find your son shaun but the sidequests add more variety for the player as with most rpgs sidequests can become repetitive but with mediation between your mainfaction quests and sidequests can allow for a better feeling of satisfaction in the title you may have noticed the word epic if youre thinking that it was just a buzzword then youve got the wrong meaning the story is an epic just like say odyssey youve got a simple goal that is made monumental in scope with some plot digressions to mix things up a bit i never felt as though the game ran stale though i imagine as time passes and people complete the game it could lose some value but there is one last thing to save the console versions of the game\\n\\nbethesda announced mod support for consoles yes you read that right mod support for too long the console versions were inferior to the pc because you were never allowed to modify your experience sometime in 2016 the creation kit for fallout 4 along with the mod support for xbox one and ps4 will be added and allow for much more interesting experiences once youve finished your main game this is already on top of dlcs and a reasonably priced season pass\\n\\nin conclusion fallout 4 is a game you will want with so much content and mostly good writing at your hands you will be able to experience things only this series can bring and the ability to modify will undoubtedly be a major factor in this games lifespan if you can overlook the minor things to be expect of a game this large you can have a great experience\\n\\ntldr mostly good graphics great wealth of additions to gameplay to switch things up story is mostly good with some writing falling to pieces mod support will expand lifespan new ui may throw you off but is otherwise easy to use this is one of those games that are going to be time consuming but every moment will be a good one i love that fact that you weapons are upgradeable and do not degrade i didnt like fallout when i first started playing but know i am a fan once i got the mechanics of the fallout while playing fallout 3 i was hooked i love story driven games assassins creed metal gear solid and fallout are my three favorite franchises in the world of fallout fallout 4 is a masterpiece i love this game i was pumped about this game as i loved fallout 3 and new vegas but this game doesnt appear to have any upgrade over those predecessors that may be okay to some but i was expecting much much more the graphics are horrible for a ps4 so many glitches choppy actions poor ai poor targeting for the activate icon the list goes on the action is choppy and boring there needs to be better autosave multiple times i had been exploring for 30 minutes and then some mutant radscorpion or something would appear and make short work of me at earlier levels and id lose everything since my last user save i understand that many people just want an immersive environment to explore unimpeded and they dont care much about the graphics or gameplay as long as they can train their characters so to them it will be a blast but for guys that want a game you can play for an hour or 2 at a time and enjoy this couldnt be worse this is coming from someone who loves skyrim dragon age kotors and many other massive rpgs the vats system had me missing shots i realistically shouldnt have the graphics are horrible the sound cuts out there is literally no end to the lag i dont see why everyone loves this game so much it is just awful the reason for this is simple they made this almost completely different from fallout 3  new vegas the story i cant relate to it in a fallout style because it feels to much like a call of duty shooter style where you have to go and absolutely kill everything and yes i emphasized that because when you have to kill an area it basically anything in that area no way around it now a shooter more so than an rpg style\\n\\nthe dialog lacks a bit the characters dont show emotions as well as i expected they would it more or less the same outcome despite what decision you make you cant really go in a different direction all together\\n\\nnow an aspect i do like but it not quite enough for me to refer this game is i love the crafting but it doesnt keep a lasting appeal for to long considering there are other games out there with crafting now that have a better purpose\\n\\nand i like the outfit choice coming back where you can wear anything you want to and it doesnt change how people see you\\n\\nbasically i gave it a five star as a moral rating if anything because there pretty equal features i like and dont like they just have different type of standing in the game\\n\\nid personally choose fallout 3 over this game to refer to a friend just because it was better story wise and how big of an effect your decisions could change the outcome of the game all dressed up with no place to go is what fallout 4 brings you biggest fail of the franchise tried too hard to make the game a competitor and in turn where there should be challenging and skillful is barely enjoyable and the fun role playing parts are beyond confusing its as backwards just a sad disappointment for fallout fans compared to fallout 3 and new vegas its okay but on its own its a great game do not believe the bad reviews its truly good however no karma system bugs and glitches and its not a real game changer for the fallout series though none the less i recommend it fallout 4 had a lot of hype and it lived up to the hype i think they improved on everything and the game is absolutely stunning one of the best games i have played in a long time best game ever i would recommend this games to all my friends and family love it  great in the series jd22 is a super fun game haven’t played since 2016 version always fun bringing out the family during the holiday time for dance battles and sweating our calorie gains from the cookies  gamestop had this game on an awesome deal and couldn’t pass up bringing some more fun to our household for the new year my daughter loves this game  we also bought the motion controllers  makes the experience  much better great game as always my niece loves it as always just like how me and my nephew were addicted to rock band i jut got this game for my ps3 and i love it buy now buy this or lego star wars the complete saga this is the best lego game ever if you like lego games then you have to get this there is all kinds of things to do the story line is goodand there is all kinds of villians to beati recomend this to eney one who likes lego games and there are all kinds of people to buy and stuff like that well bottom line is get it now well this game is awsome the best lego game everyi deffently recomend it to kids 14 and younger the best game i have every played so you need to chose a game to buy well pick this one up u wont be diapointed i had always been a fan of lego video games like lego star wars and lego indiana jones so i was bound to get this game sometime and when that time came knew it would be even better than it than previous fellow lego games i was right batman is my favorite dc superhero and for that to be mixed with one of my favorite toys was even better this game has them all the famous arch enemies of the caped crusader including the joker clayface killer croc and poison ivy plus like any other lego game you have an in game lobby were u can do various things such as play missions and collect studs in batman u get to explore the bat cave and arkham asylum like in lego star wars 2 u can make a custom character however you want which is still pretty fun to doalso there are villian missions that show the other side of all the hero missions where you see how the villians concoct there master plan overall if you like batman or lego or both you should get this game for its fun gameplay interesting storyline and hilarious characters the game is awesome plus you can choose your side the first time when i played the demo at my cousins house it was amazing  so i went out and bought it it was amazing how there is so many characters and missions plus all their powers they have and the suits and the mini clips my favorite funny clip for now is probably the part where cat woman kissed batman and then robin took his tongue out and looked like he was grossed out also on the villains side my favorite power from joker is the electric buzzer because every time you shock someone its like theyre getting a xray but getting shocked out the same time i cant wait to finish the whole game then i probably would want a lego batman 2 then3 and then continuing until they cant make any more but it kinda would help by taking most of the films they make like the cartoon reality and lego films they show and make take it and put it in the game now that would be cool for fans like me to play in plain english this game is fun youll want to play it as soon as you finish the first mission true lego game to the fullest you get to use all vehicles all suits and all characters the most fun youll have being a villain since you can play as all the villains the story mode makes sense and the free play is the best the attention to details is perfect for a game like this is not an easy game to play but it is not hard it takes a little of understanding what can and cant be done the game itself is pretty long due to the fact theres so much items to find the vehicle missions take the cake since you get to play with all batman and robin vehicles and also the villains vehicles go buy unwrap it read the instruction a little pop it in and enjoy the ride the lego name has done it again post lego star wars i have been waiting for lego batman i was disappointed with lego indiana jones which left much to be desired however as i hoped batman has been awesome before batman lego has based their gameplay solely off movie storyline and action batman has it’s own unique storyline and short clips between chapters in the game which are awesome and funny the unique story allows for new batsuits new gear new ablities and new things are not just for batman but also for robin also your main page is in the bat cave or as villains in arkham you also get access to all the batgear batboat batwing batmobile oh yeah players also get to play as the villains in their own games separate from those of batman of course all the great villains have an appearance and as true to the lego form there are the minigames the graphics are a step up for the former lego games and it has been an awesome game i just got lego batman and i must say for starters dont let the tittle fool u lego batman is much more fun then it sounds the gameplay is straight forward and the controls are very easy to pick up on another good part fans will enjoy is when u start the game off you are in the batcave and it is fully accessible you can choose to jump in the batmobile the batwing or the batboat and take off to a mission or just explore the batcave and find a bunch of goodies not to mention you can also go upstair to wayne manor for more fun the game play is entertaing to the fullest extent of a lego game plus as you progress through the game youll find different suits that reallyd to help you out through parts of the level the new batorang system makes it easir to take out thugs in a adam west fashion  the vechile levels are to die for there is many more features to lego batman and you will not be disspointed in getting this game avaible for all system but ps3 and 360 is recommended for better next gen graphic and you will be playing for the days to come this game is everything i hoped it would be and more i bought this game a week ago and have not stopped playing it\\r\\nwho would with all the water fights bought this game over a week ago and it was a fun goofy time sure there are voluptuous ninjas that lose clothing when they are defeated my wife flipped out at this lol but the game is surprisingly deep there is a lot of strategy involved when it comes to attacking weapons reloading and timing as well as the fast paced nature of the game single player campaigns will help you unlock more ability cards weapons and assist pets but the real fun is online my only gripe is that like many games from japan there is way too much dlc that one has to buy to access more perks and costumes as well as additional characters all in all it is a fun game\\r\\n\\r\\nps dressing room mode is kind ofweird youll see what i mean lol okay political ramblings aside this is nearly the ultimate in fanservice japanese anime schoolgirls in swimmy suits shooting water guns at each other 3rd person areba shooter style splatoon 2 with bewbs this is where most people would say i normally dont buy these types of games but i had to for the artistic merits and incredible story not me i like anything controversial and everything that goes against what the powers that be say is wrong inappropriate or politically incorrect i am also a fan of pretty anime schoolgirls and i do not apologize for that  i should probably mention this right now  i hate sony and i hate playstation for reasons i will not go into here lets just say fool me once shame on me fool me 126 times it must be sony i gave up fighting sony and we finally bought a ps4 this year i still hate sony but i was missing out on too many games by fighting against them  so i went over to the dark side and it wasnt so bad after all while xbox still has its amazing perks and features not found on ps4 i have found that sony does some things xbox has failed to do what they do is jrpgs fan service games side scrolling shooters and most importantly physical releases of games and true exclusives without the play anywhere pandering to the pc master race that xbox does several of my favorite bmovie style games are ps4 exclusives onechanbara earth defence force etcwhich were formally xbox 360 exclusive titles the likes of hatsune miku and the tales of series among many others are only found on ps4 then theres senran kagura and many others in oversized collectors edition boxes i loves me some collectors editions xbox has none anymore while both companies are trying to force everyone to buy digital only games its great that ps4 hasnt yet crossed the line and eliminated collectors editions  i know this was supposed to be a review of peach beach splash but the game really speaks for itself a fairly good tps with loads of fan service and a funny script  the real point of this review is to state that its time to urge others to buy both consoles this generation just as we have in the past generations xbox has an amazing backwards compatibility library and some truly great games sony has the japanese games library and some huge exclusives then theres switch all i can say is theres potential there and some day it will be worth buying its time to stop being fanboys and love both systems or in my case tolerate the others existence i just really think this could have been better the title before this one is a little better finding someone online to play with can take a while most likely because not many people play it english voice acting could have gotten  you more into the story its hard to survive and read subtitles at the same time however if you like up grading guns and characters only you will love this because thats all i do cute chicks with water guns  enough said  not a game for kids btw the gameplay is actually addicting i was surprised too i just got it 3 days ago after updating witch only took about 15 min with good net speed i played it and have to say it is a great addition to the sk family giving a new look on things as well as a more chill feel only bad part in my opinion is that theirs no english even though you can tell the voice actors tried are you kidding me noreally if youve allready played any of the senran kagura titles youve allready preordered this puppy p\\r\\n\\r\\nif youre new heres all you ned to know \\r\\nhot girls\\r\\nfrantic 3rd person shooter\\r\\nhot girls\\r\\nadorable animated cutscenes original japanese vo\\r\\nhot girls in bikinis this a one of the best games i’ve ever played and not only a racing game but just any game in general it was awesome and was really satisfying the cars looked absolutely gorgeous and sounded the part this game forza horizon 4 was a christmas gift for my nephew and he loves it this game is a very high quality racer for the xbox one that i believe is a mustown for anyone that has an xbox one the game is full of hackers now and after a a few months of playing i can say that the physics are truly one of the worst in any video game ai definitely drive on rails about to go buy it saw a freind play it and loved it the game is great graphics are excellent  and so are the sound effects the changing seasons and tracks make it pretty challenging love playing this game with friends and i know my young son will be ok watching it a great addition to the series cant wait to see what they decide to add to the series playing the game from disk has been way better than using the digital version i only preordered and got the digital version for the added content that we should also get when we get the disk best racing game to date\\r\\ngreat graphics nice gameplay doesn’t work with logitec g920 wheel too hard to steer properly this review was collected as part of a promotion ive bought a lot af monitors and this one is pretty darn nice this review was collected as part of a promotion i have not done any gaming on the tv but love it so for this review was collected as part of a promotion only the best

gaming great refresh rate with minimum to no lag colors pop off from every angle due to its curvature and picture quality is also on another level with 120hz refresh rate say goodbye to lags except you just have a terrible wifi like i used to until i switched but this is an investment you wont regret this review was collected as part of a promotion i us it for making music  gaming and video editing this review was collected as part of a promotion this is a fantastic display and possibly ahead of its time i wanted a monitor that would both offer immersive gaming for my downtime and maximum productivity for my day jobso far my experience with this monitor has been phenomenal something to keep in mindfor gaming the image quality is amazing and the added field of view for racingflyingsimulation games is definitely worth it this review was collected as part of a promotion love this monitor it look like a television i love the way it looks i was skeptical on buying this after reading some reviews about poor graphics and bugs but i did it anyways and boy am i glad i did it is bethesda game so yes there will be glitches and bugs and the occasional game freeze but if you are at familiar with their games you know that it wont take anything away from the game graphics wise i think they are in par with witcher and other games i have played on ps4 nothing spectacular but surely not anything to not pick the game up for combat is by far the most improved aspect from the previous fallouts weaponry and armor are completely customizable and running and gunning is now an option it is not as smooth as cod but a great improvement one that i am greatly pleased with if you like exploring and not really having a set path in which to play then you wont be disappointed with this game great value for the money this is a long game and fun recommended for teens that need something to do its still as fun if not better then the 3rd one i got a lot of games in the last couple months this one is in my top 3  havent ran into to many bugs but there there id wait for a path or two to fully enjoy the game experience it is a big game i know there would be a little bugs at first no big deal yet tho we waited we laughed we cried its finally here say goodbye to your family and friends for awhile if you liked any of the previous fallout games or just survival games in general or even if you didnt you will love this game its a huge improvement over them literally thousands of hours of game play even more with the addition of settlement building you wont have any buyers remorse with this game it will give you your moneys worth at least 50 times over if you have any doubts take a look at some review videos of the game i have no doubts that fallout 4 will earn game of the year the game is perfect for anyone who enjoys the fallout series howeverthe frame rate drops are soo severe that its just not playable at times the bosses are the worst besides that this game has alot of content that anyone would enjoy too bad it isnt smooth and 23  28 fps sometimes even 18 if it wasnt cause of the frame rate this game would be a sloid 10 yeah its that bad i bought this game but it was the same as the old one nobody at the store can figure out whats going on was the game not released this year  or is it a remake amazing graphics and gameplay alot of vehicles customizationgreat game highly addictive and fun to play online with friends played on xbox one x and the graphics are amazing this game is amazing from the free roam aspect to just the overall customization of basically everything i really like the fact that you can make the game harder or easier race wise and can get rewarded for it my 10 year old nephew loves all the forza games  he recd 3 for his birthday so we upgraded it to the 4 great great game dont get to play as much as i would like but would recommend graphics and gameplay are amazing so many cars to choose from its an amazing game good graphics its a great way to spend your time honestly so fun i just spent all my money on the game vip car pass dlcs and car packs it is a very good game if you are into cars and really love listening to those cars roar i mean it’s a good game it’s just i’m not really a fan of their work but like i said it’s a good game this review was collected as part of a promotion spectacular monitor just love the dual feature and crisp graphics this review was collected as part of a promotion best monitor before you consider a tv high refresh rate and good color accuracy a solid choice for work or play not ideal for image editing this review was collected as part of a promotion i use my samsung monitor for gaming and high definition movies this review was collected as part of a promotion

for anyone to enjoy a more realistic and better gaming experience great for all age groups definitely worth the money good game samsung keep up the great work this review was collected as part of a promotion the clear picture and how fast it refreshes and the clear audio excellent customer service item arrived sooner than expected highly recommended this review was collected as part of a promotion this is a great gaming monitor love the refresh rate all i can say play like a pro overall i liked this game i played this after the ffxiii series ffxv and ff7 remake the graphics are in the realm of ffxiii definitely not as good as ffxv or 7 remake but an older game so that makes sense there are elements of other older ff games  for those long time fans i like being able to explore the overworld reminds me of the 1st and 6th games the military campaign missions are fun they remind me of the game of risk leveling up is a bit of a chore but xp grinds just go that way secret training missions are a quick way though but that feels like cheating the story is good and detailed it takes a second play through to pick up some of the nuances i find the amount of characters a bit overwhelming but i think it was done that way to make multiple play throughs fresh otherwise it would get old quick trophies are realistic for those who care but be prepared to work for some i was a bit bummed about the music some of it is okay but i dont think i will like this soundtrack the other ff games have always had the best music good for study and work type stuff this one ehh not so much in summary fun different but not at the level of ffxv or remake 7 if you are a ff fan you will like it but for those just getting into the franchise pass until you have tasted the excellence of the others you owe it to yourself this review was collected as part of a promotion ive owned monitors before but this one is  by far the best and the most radiant not the most impressed by the title gameplay is cunfusing at times good graphics for its time a great game experience for all fans of final fantasy games i’m not really into the retro fighting i’m more in to the next rpg as in xv very intriguing story the camera controls werent perfect but understandable because it is a port of a handheld game not all the characters are very interesting but the combat is fun and there is a very intense ending very engaging but a little choppy on the story line still waiting to see if that pans out its early yet also mixes tactics with the normal final fantasy gameplay can either be a plus or against it depending on how you feel about tactics this is an old psp game ported to ps4 in hd i thought this game was pretty good but not as good as the other final fantasy games it’s alright not a fan of the battle mechanics but it’s not too bad not user friendly stale moves and  not easy to follow the perfect halo nerf gun for any fan solid quality shoots hard and comes with a great in game item doesn’t get much better than this i got the package but the code that came with the gun had been used before i could use it personally i will be calling to see if i can get another or if i can get one through this email it is a gift for my nephew so i haven’t personally used it opened the box to take a look at it and it seems well made works well 8 year old really loves it has been working great for several months without breaking unlike cheaper brands that stop after a week when some plastic piece breaks its lots of fun it makes a great nerf gun and the fact it came with an amazing skin for halo infinite makes it even better it has great shot range too which makes for a better weapon when playing nerf wars with friends solid unit i like that the semi auto design it shoots as fast as i can pump it whoever was the person that packaged this package deserves a raise amazing packaging had to make a note of it its everything you expect it to be when looking at it so satisfied my son cj loves the nerf gun and has been complemented multiple on having and awesome gun so that makes him even happier i was very pleased with this nerf gun its very well detained and faithful to its source material i played the beta i know the game isnt out yet\\n\\n it has 2 side attachment rails and 1 on top for a scope and comes with a built in ironsight and enough bullets to fill the magazine its also worth noting that this gun does not require batteries which is ky personal preferance\\n\\nmy only complaint is the orange drum magazine is not design to be removed once it is attached so you can only load the gun by revolving the drum magazine and load the darts a few at a time overall i was very happy with this purchase havent played in a while but a good game not much to discriminate on it is really fun to race the different seasons the added championship races like halo i found to be really fun also and i like to race that one alot amazing driving game parents this game is fun like grand theft auto but without the violence it’s the best of the forza series tons of cars to chose from and a free world to roam endless fun and contains the right amount of challenge

review was collected as part of a promotion this monitor is worth buying if you are into gaming this review was collected as part of a promotion this monitor is a very big and it curves around the table so you can see a lot more and it has very great graphics perfect for gaming this review was collected as part of a promotion in my journey to replace two ten year old monitors i found this beauty let me tell you it is amazing  for multitask business use and wonderful for music and gaming\\n\\nwould highly recommend this product  to anyone whos looking to replace a dual monitor setup this review was collected as part of a promotion had this from day 1 and absolutely in love with it had no quality issues but the firmware updates overtime resolved a lot of the issues hdr on windows makes it not so easy to switch it on or off but it is what it is a lot of the games i play can reach 240fps but i need to tone done the settings a bit since the resolution is a beast my 3080 does decent with this monitor but i recommend having a 3000 series nvidia card to truly enjoy this monitor 5 out of 5 stars this review was collected as part of a promotion i was hesitating between dells u4919dw qhd ips display and samsungs chg90 fhd va samsungs va and fhd made me tip towards dell also ive always had dell ultrasharp monitors and never was disappointed but then samsung released the crg90 with qhd resolution the same 1800r curve vs dells 3800r and high refresh rate totally won me over and bought it right away box came in with no damage and obviously never opened before so i was happy with that assembly was quick and easy never actually touched the display until it was on my desk then i noticed huge hand prints all over the left and right edges of screen there were not bare oily hand prints more dusty glove prints from whoever packaged it a quick dust off with microfiber cleaned them right up struggled a lot with the provided cables power is only 5 feet considering the routing in the back panel and through the mounts arm nearly 2 feet are already gone so you better have an outlet nearby dp hdmi and usb cables are 6 feet each pretty standard but again this monitor is huge 4 feet across so again with the routing through the back panel and arm there no a whole lot of room to do good cable management but with a bit of patience and reorganizing the desk all worked out fine then i plugged it in the pc using the provided dp cable wow was i amazed at the crazy bright permanent light streak in the bottom center of the monitor so im returning the unit for a refund the war is hear  i like this finle fantasy tittle becuse of the ways its defrent from some of the other games ware the battle systume was half one thing and half another and the story for the game goes well and is a good lead in to finle fantasy 15 wich has a similer story and batte systume very low quality compared to prior games and ffxv the next game this game is faster paced than i prefer also the effects of what i try to do in combat arent always clear kind of like ff15 its ok but i got ffx hd and am playing that instead i put about 10 or so hours into type 0 may or msy not go back to it considering this was a pspps4 remake looks great sounds great and plays fun as a fan of both mainstrram and spinoff titles happy to add this one to my play history amazing gameplay filled with action and intuitive controls the tutorial at the beginning is not the best but like i said intuitive controls make this hiccup forgetable now what i like in a game the combat wasn’t fluid ive always enjoyed the final fantasy series do i decided to try this out and it is a little different from the others i played game is much different than the other final fantasy titles because of its gameplay and overall freedom of exploration this may be the best new final fantasy i have played in years the graphics still look fairly psp in too many areas but the game is a blast that mixes in story and gameplay elements from many different final fantasy games into one very interesting game i feel that the more ff games you have played the more youll probably enjoy type 0 so if youre one of those people that has only played the 13 series this may be too much for you but if youre like me that has played all the numbers and gets the references this game is a good trip to take d final fantasy has always been about having an engaging story line and endearing you to a group of characters after playing through the game i regret ever playing it and i will be turning it in a game for me is never about the graphics because in a month of release they are old this game lacked any type of effective story telling i honestly by the end was calling them by their weapon names and finished this game simply because i felt compelled to hoping that at some point it would redeem itself some are saying this game is more mature and a darker final fantasy sorry its not darker if you play final fantasy because you love a good story and love character development dont buy this because you will be sadly disappointed pretty fun and also comes with dlc still havent gotten any attachments for it but its still fun as is i have not had nerf blaster in 10 to 12 years the blaster works great and it looks alright the look is really only a minor thing as i could attempt to paint it myself or have it painted this thing is more fun than i thought it would be happy with this product functions well and shipped quickly would purchase again this review was collected as part of a promotion monitor is anisotropic amazing for both my gaming and entertainment refresh rate is amazing for gaming and color depth looks great for watching 4k movies and tv shows this review was collected as part of a promotion well i would first off honestly give it to my brother for a christmas gift because he is the one that has video games and due to the fact that we just had a family lost use it as a time for us to reconnect and to see him smile once again it would probably blow his mind on where it came from and be speechless this review was collected as part of a promotion love this monitor for streaming one of the best monitors i have ever used if your a forza horizon fan you know what to expect great sound track fun location based off of a real location and a ton of racingthe new season adds a fun twist to the game everyone week in real life is a season for horizon online this review was collected as part of a promotion my life has changed samsung completely did not disappoint hero its a pretty good game but i think its best if you get a steering wheel and pedals for this game because of the handling and you will have better control of your vehicle but to me the cars are a bit limited though this review was collected as part of a promotion i love the great video quality that the monitor has great racing game the game challenges you with other player good online experience love the creativity in this game this review was collected as part of a promotion the monitor helps me in so many ways i love the beautiful colors and the size is fantastic fun game the lego dlc has been a huge hit for my kids and i have rather enjoyed it as well this review was collected as part of a promotion hey i bought it a couple of months ago and so far it has no dissapoit me since day one it is amazing i use it with my xbox series x to use its full potential   i will recommend every day all day i use it too to stream my favorite shows and the quality is far more greater than other monitors i love it only play if you love car games i don’t love car games and i was not really pleased with this game at all especially because it was expensive and i trades in one of favorite games for it this review was collected as part of a promotion this monitor is very clear and supports all of my uses for it highly recommend great game the graphics are sharp and crisp the game controls are precise and the story line progresses nicely not a lot of dead time in between challenges this review was collected as part of a promotion at first i was skeptical to purchase a large 49inch due to potential limitations the curve first off really paid off dividends its significant enough where you dont have to move your head left and right at all its way better than having 2 separate monitors and very comfortable to game on the only downside on this monitor is the lighting zones which is only noticeable for dark content but overall 55 love it both my 13 year daughter and i find this to be a great game when breaking away from a few days of first person shooting  we both like fast cars and we are often in competition on whos going to get the most money and best car during the wheel spins  not only that but the sound track and the scenery are great  play it once and you will see that a lot of effort and hard work went into developing this game  keep up the great work this review was collected as part of a promotion runs smooth and fast its curvature supports gaming view it’s a good game graphics are decent not a big fan of how some of the cars handle but i love everything else about it it’s a really great game once you get to playing it its a fun game i just dont like how it plays short films that you can not skip and ive been unable to find a way to purchase other cars through points ive earned in the game this game is only tolerable by hardcore final fantasy gamers im really surprised they released such garbage this game would have only been good on a handheld but dont even waste your time trust me story is completely confusing and just starts in the middle of no where originally i had picked up this game mainly for the ff xv demo but i was curious to see how good it is when i started playing i realized how fun it was so glad i picked this game up people who dislike it are either not fans of final fantasy or have not truly played this game enough this game is literally one of the darkest stories in ff history as well as a nice change in the mature feel there are tons of things to do in this game and being allowed multiple play throughs helps a ton i definitely recommend this game to any hardcore ff fans and jrpg fans alike after a play through i just dont get it i may have enjoyed this game as a hand held rpg back when it came out as a full price ps4 game it is as weak a title as youre going to find on this system the good combat is relatively fun for a while if you can stomach the camera the bad about everything else poor graphics cringeworthy voice acting seriously the worst i can recall seeing in a major title convoluted fragmented storyline uninspired environments and missions that seem to mean absolutely nothing the multiple character thing also really detracts from the weight of what little story there is and its very hard to care an extremely frustrating game that becomes very monotonous between just simply completing tasks and using your free time before the next mission\\n\\nthe game is very onedimensional in its combat design and i have just gotten tired of playing it i thought it would be great as we have been anticipating a release of the game into the americas for a while but its just so simple and easy\\n\\non top of that the game sports a glaring design flaw in which players are punished for preferring purely melee characters with limited ranged attack ability its becoming a recurring theme in the game industry to neglect melee oriented players when it comes to design and it absolutely needs to stop\\n\\nyes it can be respected that melee characters shouldnt be ranged but even our greatest real life athletes can perform dazzling aerial feats at inhuman speed every once in a while\\n\\nits really frustrating when i encounter something i cannot fight because it is exclusively ranged and will not come down and fight me because it is like i am screwed from the second i decided which character i wanted to play most just because its ranged attack capability is so limited\\n\\ni mean your ai allies are practically braindead anyway why does this game even have a party system they just get in the waywaste resources\\n\\ni didnt expect a lot being that it was a psp port but its been a pretty disappointing experience but birth by sleep and god eater were pretty similar games and were done a lot better surprisingly good even for psp games and i say that not to knock all psp games but because of the genre of the game and limitations that a psp will have compared to a console system with more buttons and superior control\\n\\ni have no outstanding opinion on the sound of the game good or bad graphically the cameras motion blur was very annoying but otherwise solid pretty game but pretty boring gameplay unfortunately\\n\\nthis game may be more suited to more casual gamers who are not as bothered by lack of polish on a game but by the time i was at chapter 7 i just didnt care what was going on in the story because i was bored out of my mind even playing the game\\n\\ni could go tons and tons more into detail with my disappointments but i dont really think its fair to keep bagging on the game for reasons i have already stated age porting a game developed for a handheld i want to say first that after playing the game for 1015 hours i plan on returning the game for store credit it hasnt kept my attention and playing it feels more like a chore at this point the graphics are decent but look like they were rendered on a ps3 instead of a ps4 combined with the disgusting motion blur effect for even slightly turning your gaze really put a damper on the graphics as they are only good looking when you stand still\\ni liked the swapout system for characters and magic requirements for different spells felt natural having to keep 12 characters leveled up and geared out at once was kind of annoying at first but i got used to it\\n\\ni would not recomend this game simply because it feels like it was slapped together and still has some very obvious kinks to be worked out there are waaaay too many characters and you can sort of tell from the gameplay and graphics that type 0 is originally for the psp but other than that the game was fairly decent the story was good overall if theres anything bad to say about the story telling its that it was slightly predictable the gameplay was unique to other ff games and it was an action rpg instead of turnbased so that was fun in its own way if youre a fan of final fantasy this isnt a bad game to get it also comes with a demo of ffxv so why not i love final fantasy i love jrpgs and i love this game the story is excellent the graphics are breath taking the camera is a little odd but all around good i love the game came out beast like the previews its nice to have a final fantasy in the series thats more open combat this game is different from the other ff games because it is really dark there is a decent amount of blood and destruction which kind of grips you as far as all of the people complaining about the story and elements being so confusing i dont really think they bothered to watch the in game cgs or read the in game historical texts it is not that confusing and every element is explained if you take the time to look and listen there are 3 levels of difficulty in the game and even on cadet it can be somewhat of a challenge i grew up with turned based jrpgs and to write off this game because isnt turn based is a shame limiting yourself is unfortunate because the game is actually very good and provides well over 100 hours worth of content replay and activities the camera can get you a little dazed but it isnt a deal breaker the graphics could have certainly been remastered a little better but there are moments when the game looks absolutely fantastic i use the remote play feature on my vita sometimes and it plays amazingly considering it was originally a psp game square enix should have offered this game as a vita title as well but that is a different issue the ff xv demo was a very nice addition and does take some getting used to i own ff 1 through 14 and enjoy each game for its differences and uniqueness none of them are perfect but they all offer something decent towards the final fantasy series i really dont understand why people say this isnt a final fantasy game its just an actionrpg not a turnbased its a very refreshing change to the series people complain that there are ranged enemies and they are using a full melee squad well thats just dumb its still a final fantasy game so tactics are still used a lot you have to make a team that makes sense if you play the turnbased versions you wouldnt put 4 tanks or 4 dps in at once why because its stupid that aside the combat is fun given you have the brains to make the fun happen some characters are useless a lot of them are really interesting you can tell the graphics come from psp there are way too many characters to keep leveled though the story is meh very predictable if you are a fan of actionrpgs this is definitely a fantastic game to get this review was collected as part of a promotion i normally use my monitor for work and sometimes games but very rare mostly work one thing i find useful on this is the curved display it really gives the perfect angle and view when your multitasking work project this review was collected as part of a promotion its excellent monitor wide and sharp picture perfect for office use too this review was collected as part of a

hightech and professional impression when customers enter the office this review was collected as part of a promotion im kind of spoiled by all the great benefits of this seriously upgraded gaming screen i dont think i could go without it now its the next biggest step in making it seem like youre actually in the game this review was collected as part of a promotion i used it at my friends house

one out there hdr has significantly improved from older generation curve is just perfect to replace two 27 inches monitor now my desk looks so much better and clutter free thanks samsung this review was collected as part of a promotion i was skeptical at first about buying this monitor but i am so glad i did this is the best monitor i have ever used its amazing picture and big screen are perfect for gaming work school anything you have planned for it i promise it will do definitely dont be hesitant give this monitor a try great for collectors gamestop had the best price looks great a perfect pop figure for the spooky season and any fan of nightmare before christmas accidentally purchased this when i meant to purchase it for pc since its nonrefundable ill never be able to use it all forza games are great fun to play with lots of thinks to do amazing graphics on xbox one x if you’re looking for great car customization this isn’t the game you’re looking for it has some but not very in depth\\r\\nif you’re looking for a game with lots of great amazing and weird cars with an open world go anywhere aspect then this game is for you great beautiful graphics really gives you the racing experince from dirt road and snow changes the whole driving experince for each one love it i absolutely adore this game i’ve probably put 100 hours into it great game amazing graphics this was my first xbox game too many customization options and a big map literally like playing gta 5 without guns its weird remember how all the previous forza horizons had beautiful graphics forza horizon 4 does too remember how horizon 1 was more arcade  not as real horizon 4 is a mixture of sim  arcade heavier toward sim to me remember when you could win a car or credits on the wheel spin on horizon 3 on 4 you have the chance to get pink mittens to wear as you drive it is very difficult to drive a ferrari 458 manual with mittens on im not bashing forza  its still a great game my point is the creators have made such a great game from the start and now seem to be going in a strange direction no one i know buys a racing game to dress up their avatar who is inside of a car most of the time the cars australia the weather changes once a week are all nice but please poll the audience  ask what we want i doubt very many would request a silver disco skirt for their male cowboy avatar  but i may be wrong game play visual is stunning with proper setup only played a few times and game has frozen twice just working bugs out i hope great game lots of fun events and things to do to keep you interested great graphics somewhat dull story line and vehicle sounds seem to be off to me but it’s still a great buy they don’t have a supra anymore which broke my heart because with the physics of this game and the sounds it would have been a beast like usual but other than that it’s my favorite game been playing forza horizon since the first edition came out and been platting forza since the 3rd one for the 360 bought a xbox one just for forza games great sweatshirt inside is very comfortable as well as the outside im pretty picky with long sleeve cuffs and this sweatshirt nailed it with the size not too large not to small with the perfect give that will still allow the shirt to hold onto my arms when pulled up and fit nice and snug when pulled down bottom hem also fits great and is not too saggy with plenty of give print is great and centered perfectly and is barley noticeable when touched drawstrings have a metal ring so the sweatshirt material shouldnt rip with wear sweatshirt is not too thick but also not too thin hood is also a great fit id say this is a top notch quality sweatshirt that didnt miss on the quality details that make a long lasting clothing item  \\r\\n  \\r\\njust waiting to see all the planets especially the moon first of all i would like to state that i know that this is a remake of the japanese version of a hand held console i understand this completely i am a huge final fantasy buff and have been waiting for this for a long time the games story is somewhat vague but good enough to follow i would have expected that they would have done a better job with the graphics and gameplay motion the game was so choppy and unclear that i sometimes could not even follow what i myself were trying to do this is not what i have become accustomed to when playing a game on the ps4 all in all it is worth the money to buy and play simply because you are a final fantasy fan but for a regular gamer i would not recommend this the best thing about this game coming out was the final fantasy xv demo that part was fantastic i got the day one edition and i never heard of this classic game overall it is really good the controls to play are completely different from other final fantasy so it will take time to adjust the graphics and gameplay is really good if you got the day one edition then it will come with a code for final fantasy xv demo overall if you want to try something that is different from many other final fantasy games then this be the way to go it is impressive the gameplay is almost straight from dirge of cerberus sp and can be a bit hectic at first i hate how everything is the square button when there are buttons we dont even use you can also tell this game was made for the psp i also think there are way too many characters to choose from the war missions are kinda cool but i get tired of constantly worrying if i am missing anything i would recommend this game for the free demo it comes with if your a long time fan then youll enjoy this game enough to play it twice which is whats expected otherwise wait till 15 type0 is an okay game i havent finished the game yet but the story line is interesting enough to keep playing the beginning of this game is what impressed me the most the story telling and the emotional impact of the drama i found was like no other final fantasy war is depicted in this game as ruthless bloody and ugly an army ravaging a city hellbent on victory you witness the slaughter of many those who are innocent civilians those who at the moment of dying being finished off without hesitation then you witness one with the will to survive its agonizing to watch someone dying but at the same time inspiring to see the will to live after the opening events i was left very solemn but excited to start playing this game probably the best opening to any final fantasy ive played this game quite a bit but it doesnt continue with the same intensity of story telling then again im sure it has some great moments i havent reached yet its a very unique game kind of reminds me of persona 4 somewhat type0 actually blends quite a bit of other final fantasy elements into this game im really not being really critical of this game not everyone will enjoy certain aspects i really think the level developmentoutlay of the areas you visit are basicsimple at best although im only 3 to 4 hours into this game from what i saw this seems to be the norm im positive this game will have quite a bit of replay value more characters then any other final fantasy you will have at your disposal difficulty selection will be nice for the hardcore gamer i started on the officer difficulty and its not that challenging at least not for me the graphics are okay im not complaining although some people might think its garbage because it doesnt resemble a next gen playstation 4 game its in high definition its very smoothfluid the textures such as the grass are not bad but then again it doesnt look like final fantasy xv speaking of final fantasy xv you get a code to download it its around 52 gigabytes so download it its really fun open world great graphics and a new fighting system this demo is worth the purchase of type0 in my opinion the demo will take you a few hours to complete which is good because you wont finish it too fast the time changes from day to night the night invites tougher monsters for an added challenge and gains the group some experience you will get to reap once you rest at a campground theres witty banter between the group as you explore the world which makes the travel a little more interesting as you travel to objectives getting in a battle the enemy sees you a red line flashes across the screen until it expands the entire width of the screen you can also hide by pressingholding the l2 button then get out of view behind a tree or rock its also a really suspenseful game you will see once you start the hunt for dead eye also you will find a summon you will like this a lot i did but dont take my word for it try it out yourself thanks for reading hope my reviews helps i found this to be a great game different then older ones but still interesting i though it was great getting xvs demo with it alsoxvs demo was pretty good definitely looking forward to xv coming out this device claims that it will allow you to connect a xbox one controller to your switch  you cannot connect through bluetooth with this device  you have to connect a bluetooth xbox adapter to the device  there are other devices available that will allow you to connect without an additional adapter  not gamestops fault the manufacturer is misleading people on the packaging takes the grindy aspect out of gathering and hatching eggs in pokemon swordshield i would recommend it if you are impatient and dont enjoy the grindy nature of shiny hunting like me i think theres a version coming out that will additionally support brilliant diamondshining pearl so you may want to hold off and wait for that one but idk the full details cant say much about other games or its ability to connect to anything but a switch pro controller because i havent cared to try yet it’s great for me seeing i could use a ps4 controller on my switch read some great reviews and purchased this for a christmas gift gamestop has always provided great products and services in the past so expect the same with this purchase it’s perfect for pokémon shiny hunting but nintendo has since made the watt grinding impossible so don’t buy it for watts i’ve gotten 911 shinies in the span on a week bought it for pokémon shield and works as intended online guides are extremely helpful the muscle memory of other controllers can be used on the switch needs a prefab manuel for cheat activation and you can only connect 1 kind of other console controller at a time tried using 2 ps4 controlers to no avail it has helped a lot since i dont regularly use the switch controllers works amazing but a little confusing on directions this review was collected as part of a promotion so i used to use 2 screens along with my laptop screen and from the time i bought this monitor it made my life pretty easy with navigation of tabs im mad that why i didnt i buy this earlier when covid just started it kind of makes sense to see the same brightness on wide monitor it keeps my eye happy with no tears this review was collected as part of a promotion i cannot even say how awesome this curvedmonitor is and it makes a wholesome experience for gaming and movie watching i got model lc49g97tssnxdc  i have no flickering issues at all windows 11 hdr doesnt seem to work maybe my 3060ti isnt strong enough perhaps regardless even without hdr this monitor is insane 120hz out of the box is fine with me if i had a rtx 3090 i could get 240hz that will be nice some day anyway packaged great got here in a couple days i am blown away try forza 5 on this thing and jaws drop dont hesitate awesome awesome monitor this review was collected as part of a promotion ive had this monitor for over a year and it is bye far my best purchase i want another one to continue my streaming this review was collected as part of a promotion design picture quality setup on any where and splendid for gaming and office use this review was collected as part of a promotion this product  is awesome  samsung  is a real tv game phone  technology this review was collected as part of a promotion is a good monitor for multitasking i use it for gamingtwitch this review was collected as part of a promotion i dont play any games i baught this monitor to monitor to explore the potential of productivity gain for my every day software development tasks and im extremely happy with this monitor im making use of ms powertool for defining custom layouts which i believe is a must on this kind of monitors i use hotkeys to place windows in my custom defined layout which works really well for this monitor my work requires a lot of visualization of data and generous space on the screen is very helpful and definitly allows me do what wasnt possible with traditional monitors im a machine learning  ai engineer and this monitor feels like a must for modern ai development generous screenspace adds a lot to the productivity this review was collected as part of a promotion great specs awesome curved looked the oled feature is what sets it apart though this review was collected as part of a promotion this is by far the best ultrawide monitor samsung has ever made  the minileds make a significant impact on immersion by allowing it to produce deep blacks nearly replicating that of oleds   its hard to imagine living without the neo g9  it provides everything you want from a monitor combining productivity and gaming all into one perfect eyecandy delight this is a really fun fighting game to pit two of the greatest sets of characters of any game lots of fun and cool finishing moves its a good game but the controls for this game cam sometimes not be great great game loved it back in the day and even more now good nostalgia feel this is not a the best mk  everbut is a good game wonderful game but i was not informed that the used copy does not come with the ultimate addons code very very disappointed that i wasnt told about this yes it makes sense i understand but i wish i would have been told great fighting concept very rare to have batman fight scorpion it’s a fun game with realistic real cars from real life i like the fact the game has so many car brands the gameplay is traditional mortal kombat and the cutscenes and story are entertaining graphics were great in 2009 but appear very dated in 2019 unfortunately the online servers were only supported until about 2014 so if you find the game today 2019 you wont be able to play online also we have bought two copies of the disc and both of them froze at point in story mode so there may be some latent problems with the disc in build quality like cheaper materials that make the disc wear out or more susceptible to minor scratches or dust buy it play it realistic driving experience  with awesome cars and paint jobs its a great game great controls graphics are great as well outstanding game gorgeous visuals tight controls tons of content and the newly added seasons are a blast to play around with the best entry in the franchise easy game play for kids and adults classic battles if you have a 4k tv and xbox one graphincs are amazing gameplay is pretty realistic awesome cars and a lot of fun great story the mechanics are eh youll get used to it plus its not like youre buying it to play competitive right you bought it for the story right its something you can lay back with unless youre in a race that is lol super fun to play exactly what i wanted it to be like i absolutely love this game i consider myself a causal gamer and i first got introduced to horizon 3 and fell in love the racing style combined with the great car selection and customization is an awesome mix when i got horizon 4 i was relieved to find out how they kept all the good stuff the same but added more cool features such as weather change and character customization also there are new  and interesting events such as stunts and perks for your cars as with all horizon games there is also a good balance of keeping it challenging and entertaining also very rewarding game the more you put in the more you get out love the game first time owning a forza game i need to buy a steering wheel because it’s pretty hard for me to drive with a regular controller the game play is pretty cool great game but more of the same graphics are superb and the racing is as real as it gets great racing game for driving fun would recommend 910'"
